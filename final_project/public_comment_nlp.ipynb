sent him an email CeCe\\n4:58:39\\nthe mayor and other council members about this the questions were\\n4:58:44\\ndemilitarizing the police racial profiling was being done about it\\n4:58:50\\nuse of force guidelines who can fire a bad cop can the city manager fire a bad\\n4:58:58\\ncop or is it only just this chief of police or can the city council go into\\n4:59:03\\nspecial session and fire a bad cop um more non-lethal options like in Japan\\n4:59:11\\nthey have these net guns that they can shoot a net over somebody that'll trip them up and uh\\n4:59:19\\nmobile demobilize them um what are we going to do about the endless harassment of the poorest\\n4:59:26\\nmembers of our society and then uh we need to bring back a\\n4:59:32\\npolice review board and a police review board that has some teeth not a cute toothless one like the one that was\\n4:59:39\\naround before now the other issue is the zoom meetings these Zoom meetings are terrible\\n4:59:45\\nhalf of the uh what is being said is unintelligible\\n4:59:51\\nCynthia Matthews has the worst connection of anybody I can barely\\n4:59:57\\nunderstand anything she says on here and I don't you know it's probably not

approved\\n5:01:11\\nas soon as possible I know that because it's difficult so that's pretty much but this\\n5:01:18\\nsort of gathering necessarily it's more of a protest it supports of black lives\\n5:01:23\\nmatter by artists and the approval and supportive of government and I think it shows where the Santa Cruz Community\\n5:01:28\\nstands um it's for instance those as well as really a call to action for racial\\n5:01:34\\nEquity practices the implemented in places in our community where they're not perfect\\n5:01:40\\ngreat thank you\\n5:01:47\\nonline hi there my name is Jace Richie uh thank\\n5:01:54\\nyou for taking my call um over the last hour and a half about\\n5:02:01\\num I've gotten to hear a lot of the priorities of what this uh community and\\n5:02:06\\nthe city council value and it's been frustrating to know that the public\\n5:02:12\\ncommentary which was set to begin an hour and a half ago is pushed to now but I am grateful for the opportunity to\\n5:02:19\\nhear that like myself in a number of my friends and colleagues\\n5:02:24\\nthe city council members care deeply about the people of\\n5:02:31\\nthe vet they can consider that When developing in more detail as a budget to\\n5:02:38\\ncommit to defunding the police department of Santa Cruz a police department that is known\\n5:02:46\\nfor and has a history of violence against black and brown people and a\\n5:02:54\\ncity that needs to reinvest public infrastructure in things like affordable housing\\n5:03:02\\nall right thank you\\n5:03:09\\nPhoenix call you one minute hi my name is Chrissy Hansen mayor\\n5:03:15\\nCummings and City Council Members most of you know me my husband is a Santa\\n5:03:20\\nCruz police officer and I'm calling to implore you to please do not defund or reallocate any money that is allocated\\n5:03:27\\nfor the police department it is of utmost importance for officer safety and\\n5:03:33\\nCommunity safety as you all know we just lost Sergeant butzweiler my husband was\\n5:03:38\\nthere during that incident and it brings it home that these officers men and women\\n5:03:44\\nall over our County put their hearts and souls into their jobs we all know there\\n5:03:50\\nare bad apples in every single job out there but the men and women of the Santa\\n5:03:55\\nCruz Police Department put their hearts and souls into their jobs and they try to do the best they possibly can for our\\n5:04:01\\ncommunity it really truly boils down to officer safety and Community safety and I\\n5:04:08\\nimplore you to look into doing research in other states and states and countries\\n5:04:15\\nwho have defunded or reallocated money and see what the consequences have been we already have this catch and released\\n5:04:22\\nand our did a lot of hats please do not defend\\n5:04:28\\nthe police department thank you so much for your time thank you\\n5:04:36\\nall right next speaker okay this is Garrett Phillip the writers\\n5:04:41\\nthe arsonists the looters and the anarchists and all of those who want to hijack George Floyd's family's\\n5:04:47\\nlegitimate demand for justice to further their own personal agendas of division chaos and violence should be condemned\\n5:04:55\\nand stopped he sure was a victim of a deadly civil rights righteous officer of that city\\n5:05:01\\ngovernment notice I say deadly civil rights abuse and not systemic racism the\\n5:05:06\\noutrage should be the same regardless of race and concentrated on government civil rights abuses\\n5:05:13\\nand restoring accountability for all government actions needs Focus instead of the inflammatory leftist knee jerk\\n5:05:19\\nclaim of systematic racism which would raise more than accusations and statistics the Lloyd response reminds me\\n5:05:26\\nof the last credible protest of abuse at the hands of the powerful namely Occupy Wall Street where their message of\\n5:05:32\\ncriminal banking fraud got delegitimatized forgotten and then crushed by the delusion of the hordes\\n5:05:37\\nhave left a special agenda grievance bongers inappropriately trying to hijack that Financial abuse issue for their own\\n5:05:43\\nagendas the result was no reform in the now dare I say we are seeing the BLM the\\n5:05:49\\nanarchists the looters the Vandals terrorists antifa the national dirty code tactician press and political\\n5:05:56\\nparties taking Focus away from the central issue of an unaccountable government abuse of power for their own\\n5:06:02\\npurposes kind of risking another failure or probably worse they might succeed in\\n5:06:08\\ndestroying Society thanks bye thank you\\n5:06:18\\nall right next speaker you're on the line hi my name is Edith I'm a Santa Cruz resident I want to First acknowledge\\n5:06:25\\nthat we are on the unseated territory of mamamutu I acknowledge the voices in the community that are asking for abolishment of the police in solidarity\\n5:06:31\\nwith the black lives matter movement according to the city budget proposal scpd is asking for over 400 000 more the\\n5:06:36\\nnext fiscal year which is grand total increased over 3 million since 2019. as the city must cut costs due to covid-19\\n5:06:42\\nwe must focus our budget on care and resources not surveillance and state violence according to police\\n5:06:48\\nscorecard.org fcpd uses more Force batons tasers and strangleholds per arrests and 23 percent of police\\n5:06:54\\ndepartments in California that is both a physical and mental cost of violence and to error terror on our community as well\\n5:07:00\\nas the monetary cost of those weapons if we really want to save money and the work of our community stop sending local\\n5:07:05\\npolice to other communities such as Oak lift if we want to build a better Santa Cruz postcoded disarm scpd instead of\\n5:07:11\\nfunding their pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms tasers tear gas and riot gear to use on protesters to have\\n5:07:16\\nbeen peaceful so far direct that money to our house as community members our families and our students who needed a\\n5:07:21\\nlot more than white homeowners need a sense of safety provided by the legacy of the

I actually had\\n5:07:57\\ntried to comment um item number 16 and for some reason my star nine didn't hit\\n5:08:03\\nso just real briefly there's an issue there I know it was already passed on second meeting but\\n5:08:09\\num that's the uh mandatory involuntary election contribution limits and it's\\n5:08:15\\nunclear whether that applies in recall candidate elections as we just had\\n5:08:21\\nbecause there this year with this last recall and I don't want to relive the past it's over\\n5:08:26\\nbut um the I think that you should make it clear whether they intent of that is to apply\\n5:08:34\\nto recall candidates as well because there was a violation if it was\\n5:08:40\\nthank you very much thank you\\n5:08:46\\nall right next speaker you're online\\n5:08:54\\nall right uh the next speaker I am Vice chair of the Santa Cruz Arts\\n5:09:01\\nCommission uh first thank you for your time I would like to bring to your attention uh an\\n5:09:08\\napplication for a permit uh presented by Abby Mustafa for a special event held on\\n5:09:16\\nFront Street that is a mural for black lives matter\\n5:09:21\\num I believe this requires immediate attention from the council and once\\n5:09:27\\nagain thank you for everything\\n5:09:42\\nhello hello yeah I'm Ron my name is Peter\\n5:09:49\\nBinky I live in Santa Cruz I've been a resident here since 2014. I want to begin by saying that we are in the\\n5:09:54\\nunseated territory of up Indians represented by the ominous and tribal bands that black lives matter and\\n5:10:00\\nalthough I will never understand the black experience of racism I stand with black people and people of color\\n5:10:06\\nI would like to spend my experience and thought on the conduct and priorities\\n5:10:12\\nI've worked as a security guard in Santa Cruz since 2015 beginning at the Crow's Nest and the Blue Lagoon until 2018 and\\n5:10:19\\nfrom 2018 the president at Brady's Yacht Club in the time I have had to handle stabbings drive-by shootings assaults\\n5:10:25\\nand talkative people and survive with minimal harm to myself and no harm to others on April 20th 2018 I was attacked and\\n5:10:33\\nassaulted for being gay a stranger assaulted me out of nowhere inside the AC referring to me as a I am a gay\\n5:10:40\\nman after leaving the house see my assailant with some other attack myself and a friend\\n5:10:45\\nI had to call this cpv three times over two days to get someone to take a statement I was told they were very busy\\n5:10:52\\nand put them to be immediately that this was not a priority I understand that there are more important issues in the\\n5:10:58\\nhate crime but I feel that it should be a priority after a month I finally had a follow-up\\n5:11:03\\nthere was video evidence of the assault that that was it other than a letter saying you're the victim of a crime I'm\\n5:11:10\\ngoing to stop you thank you for providing us with that information and let us know if we can follow up with you\\n5:11:15\\non uh suggesting that sounds like a pretty serious concern thank you for calling in\\n5:11:22\\nhey all right Mr Speaker hi there I just wanted I just wanted to reach out as a born and\\n5:11:29\\nraised resident of Santa Cruz to just address the allocation of our tax dollars and policing in our community\\n5:11:35\\num with kova 19 City staffers have been recommending that we like cut upwards to six million dollars in spending and I\\n5:11:42\\nthink it's about the time that the city looks at how much spending is going into the police department and how much we're actually\\n5:11:48\\ngetting out of it as a community I to reevaluate the city's Financial relationship with policing in ways that\\n5:11:55\\nlike like there's uh in ways like making officers um liable for misconduct settlements and\\n5:12:01\\nnot taxpayers from withholding pensions and we're not hires who are involved with excessive\\n5:12:07\\nboards and abuse uh claims as well as spending paid leave for costs who are under investigation but I think it's\\n5:12:13\\nreally really important that we just stop sending our police to terrorize other communities I don't know why Santa\\n5:12:19\\nCruz is allowing their cops to go and trample on another community's right to pre-spread free speech like that system\\n5:12:26\\nlike wrong side of History stuff I really think we need to end Aid agreement\\n5:12:32\\num you know our city doesn't mirror large urban areas but um find themselves assaulted with militarized police forces\\n5:12:37\\nSanta Cruz has in many ways already been a leading example of what a community-led resource could be but I\\n5:12:44\\nthink it's far from good enough and I hope that the council takes this to heart and will push for official time\\n5:12:49\\nfor the community to express and that's their concerns thank you\\n5:12:56\\nall right next speaker yeah hi my name's Al and I really\\n5:13:02\\nappreciate everything you guys do I know it's a hard job first of all I wanted to say that the events that happened over\\n5:13:08\\nthe weekend with the murder of the deputy sheriff Damon gotzwell has really shaken us all up here\\n5:13:14\\num and it it happens 250 days after one\\n5:13:19\\nof my best friends tusharate was also kidnapped and murdered from his home in pleasure points and\\n5:13:25\\num both with senseless acts of violence um and uh I I've I've been here in Santa\\n5:13:31\\nCruz for a few years and it's been a shock to us that the level of violence here is so high and we believe Annie\\n5:13:39\\nMills and his chief and and and mayor Justin Cummins thank you so much for your courageous and calming impact on\\n5:13:46\\nduring the BLM um riding downtown it showed a level of\\n5:13:51\\nsort of discipline and and Leadership that I hadn't seen before and of course I was in the the marches as well as the\\n5:13:58\\npaddle outs for BLM I support everything that they do but I really urge you do not tap the police in fact if you feel\\n5:14:04\\nlike you need to increase it I'm a big supporter of that thank you for everything that you do and we hope we\\n5:14:10\\ncan get back to a community with respect love and and all the values that we really appreciate\\n5:14:15\\nthank you all right next speaker you're online\\n5:14:23\\nhi um my name is Josh grobinski I live in Santa Cruz I want to say I'm really saddened by the violence against the\\n5:14:29\\npolice this weekend um and I think that there's a way to create a community where the polarization became the police and\\n5:14:35\\nthe people um is really different the recent events in Minneapolis and covert crisis create\\n5:14:40\\nan opportunity to think differently and I think a serious look at how we can rethink the kinds of Power police have and use\\n5:14:46\\nwe don't need a person with a gun to respond to the vast majority of mental health situations we don't need a person with a gun to deal with a forged 20 Bill\\n5:14:52\\nwe don't need a person with a gun to give a speeding ticket we don't need a person with a gun to support homeless people and the list goes on we need\\n5:14:58\\npeople trained to deal with difficult and most situations not trained to catch criminals which means that we don't need\\n5:15:04\\nthe police in many many many situations we need to defund the police and there's a whole bunch of things we can do I mean\\n5:15:10\\nlook at what's happening in Minneapolis so let's be fun to Santa Cruz Police and while we're figuring out how to make that work continuing the hiring free\\n5:15:17\\nzone please right now for police out of Oakland and just notice that if we're spending 30 million dollars with 100 million dollar Budget on the cops that\\n5:15:24\\nis way way too much [Music] foreign\\n5:15:34\\nhi my name is Caitlin Hannah I've been a resident of Santa Cruz for 14 years\\n5:15:40\\nin response to the black lives matter movement and Countrywide calls for defunding the police I expect the\\n5:15:45\\ncouncil to create a special session or an agenda item at the very least on the next meeting with regards to the\\n5:15:51\\ndefunding of the scpd and the underfunding of humanitarian and Social Services\\n5:15:57\\nover the year I've witnessed countless hours and dollars spent through the scpd on asking our unhoused population to\\n5:16:05\\nmove to move to move to not sit here to not lay down here I feel that that the\\n5:16:11\\nscpd's labor efforts and funds are grossly misused and in need of major reallocation thank you\\n5:16:24\\nall right next caller year online\\n5:16:33\\nhello can you hear me yes how are you my name is Andrew Carlson I'm a local uh\\n5:16:39\\nmaker fabricator prototyper and business consultant and I have a budget a bunch\\n5:16:44\\nof budgetary questions I hope I have the right data here um but my understanding is that you're\\n5:16:50\\nasking to cut six million dollars out of the budget and ironically you're asking to increase the police budget to 28.1\\n5:16:58\\npercent which would be larger than the library Public Works Economic Development combined\\n5:17:04\\num and also there's been an insufficient response to Cova especially in terms of PPE my maker lab has actually been\\n5:17:10\\nproducing a ton of that and it's not been going well it's about the communities are funded so\\n5:17:17\\nso I'd like to ask why are we not suspending paid admin for cops who are\\n5:17:22\\nunder investigation for excessive violence for example and why do we have\\n5:17:27\\n23 higher excessive force when it comes to\\n5:17:33\\nper arrest so 23 higher rate per arrest violence compared to any other PD and\\n5:17:41\\nhopefully anyway I would like to if you find the place thank you [Music]\\n5:17:49\\nthank you very much all right next person you're online\\n5:17:59\\nhi my name is my name is Elena Ramer I want to demand\\n5:18:05\\nthe city of Santa Cruz immediately begin a process of defunding the police and begin supporting the needs of our\\n5:18:11\\ncommunities in ways that will eventually make police obsolete that means housing\\n5:18:16\\nfor all health care for all including mental health care and addiction treatment and other services for all who are in\\n5:18:23\\nneed it means emergency responders who are not cops and who are trained in Conflict mediation\\n5:18:29\\nwho are mental health care providers and social workers the city needs to support and fund marginalized communities in\\n5:18:35\\nSanta Cruz they deserve care not cops doing so will be a baby step towards\\n5:18:40\\nrepairing the damage that has been done by over policing police brutality police complicity with ice gentrification and\\n5:18:48\\nthe general whitewashing of Santa Cruz history and culture we can't settle for reforms that have been tried and have\\n5:18:53\\nfailed in other cities fight for the future we want and deserve while you're at it and cash bail and end Juvenile\\n5:18:59\\nDetention now foreign\\n5:19:13\\nKessler and I'm a resident of Santa Cruz County thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak I'm asking for the\\n5:19:20\\ncouncil to not approve an increase in budget for the police force and to instead allocate more funds to education\\n5:19:26\\nhousing and community-based programs in Santa Cruz I was shocked to learn that\\n5:19:31\\npolicium took 12 percent of the city's budget in 2018 while only 1.8 percent\\n5:19:36\\nwent to housing I feel strongly that the police force does not need more funding especially since Santa Cruz Police\\n5:19:43\\nDepartment uses more Force per arrest than 23 percent of other police departments in California\\n5:19:50\\nalso be following how each council member votes to determine who I would like to elect in the future as well\\n5:19:55\\nthank you for your time\\n5:20:02\\nhey next speaker hello my name is Jesse Malley I'm

proposal I want to list out some important numbers\\n5:22:07\\nagain a budget deficit of 10 to 20 million due to covid-19 and the sheriff's office is asking for an 8\\n5:22:13\\nmillion dollar increase in the next fiscal year which is completely unacceptable\\n5:22:18\\nbefore my time is up I'd like to summarize some things that I think we should make a priority in the next meeting deep on the police and allocate\\n5:22:24\\nthe money and resources to Oregon Nations that are specialized in various professions such as social workers and medical suspend use of paid admin leave\\n5:22:32\\nfor cops under investigation withhold pension from and don't rehire cops involved in excessive force require cops\\n5:22:38\\nto be liable for misconduct settlements not taxpayers withdrawn participation of lease militarization programs and\\n5:22:44\\nMilitary exercises disarm the sctd no more pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms armored vehicles tasers tear\\n5:22:51\\ngas or riot gear we are people and you are not at war with us thank you for listening\\n5:22:57\\nyep\\n5:23:04\\nall right next speaker good evening everyone my name is Rachel Martinez and I'm a Santa Cruz resident I\\n5:23:11\\nwould first like to agree with Caitlin Hannah's request that the council hold a special session for defunding the scpd I\\n5:23:18\\nfind it extremely concerning that there's over four hundred thousand dollars proposed for the scpd in the upcoming budget it's embarrassing to be\\n5:23:25\\nliving in a city that boasts progressiveness while sending combat ready officers to a historically black community disciple the voices of their\\n5:23:32\\nresidents I'm ashamed to live in a city that values a violent and oppressive Police Department over the health and\\n5:23:37\\nsafety of their citizens defund our Police Department invest in our community and let Santa Cruz be the\\n5:23:43\\nprogressive Haven you all pretend it is thank you thank you\\n5:23:55\\nhi can you hear me yes hey my name is Rachel Chavez I'm at RN\\n5:24:01\\nwho's lived in Santa Cruz most my life and I've asked I'm here today to ask you to deep on the police services like\\n5:24:06\\nhousing education and Healthcare have been drained of funds that were siphoned off to an increasingly militarized police force Santa Cruz you only have to\\n5:24:13\\nwalk around downtown for a minute or so to see the devastating effects of lack of housing in our community in 2018\\n5:24:18\\nfunding for housing took up only 1.8 percent of the budget Community programs two percent while policing took up 12\\n5:24:24\\npercent policing is inherently resistant system in Santa Cruz in 2015 black\\n5:24:30\\npeople made up 4.3 percent of all arrests and only 0.9 percent of the total population but Andy Mills will\\n5:24:36\\ntell you that scpd is too enlightened to act in a racist manner this shows either total misunderstanding or an absolute\\n5:24:42\\nrefusal to acknowledge how systemic racism is for a petulated in systems but can look to Minneapolis to see that\\n5:24:48\\npolice reform is implicit bias trading an equivalent unequivocally do not do enough police still wind up murdering\\n5:24:54\\nblack people with impunity [Music] thank you thank you\\n5:25:03\\nhey I'm Milan hi my name is Madison I'm a long-time resident of Santa Cruz\\n5:25:10\\njust wanted to offer my thoughts to our council members as we set priorities for our budget in the upcoming weeks I would\\n5:25:15\\nlike to see the city of Santa Cruz adopt a socially responsible budget that prioritizes Health and Welfare spending\\n5:25:21\\nover policing nearly a third of our city General funds are dedicated to policing\\n5:25:26\\nand my understanding that the police have requested a budget increase for the 28-21 fiscal year this request should be\\n5:25:33\\nrejected employees funding should be reallocated toward a Health and Welfare programs reallocating resources would\\n5:25:38\\nprotect the most vulnerable in our community as the city reckons with the consequences of decreasing resources to\\n5:25:43\\nmeet the essential needs of its residents and I would just like to say if you fail to prioritize people over police in your\\n5:25:49\\nbudget considerations not only will I not vote for you when the time comes but I will do everything in my power to help\\n5:25:55\\nreplace you with more Progressive Challengers thank you for your time yep\\n5:26:04\\nhello hello\\n5:26:09\\noh hi um so I'm a downtime resident my name is McKenna\\n5:26:15\\num and I'm calling to ask that you based on the police because um they're funded too heavily and they're\\n5:26:22\\ntrying to pass ordinances like the quality of life ordinance that actually asks uh that is he criminalized to have\\n5:26:28\\nsyringes on you without a prescription and other things like camping from 7 A.M to 10 pm and then 10 pm to 7 A.M which\\n5:26:35\\ndoesn't make any sense um and yeah I just think the attacking of\\n5:26:41\\nhomeless people in this community has gone on for far too long I think it's a waste of our time Santa Cruz PD PR uh\\n5:26:46\\ndoes more misdemeanor arrests than 98 of police departments of California according to policegorecard.com and yeah\\n5:26:54\\nI would just say just defund the police um we don't need them to have weapons that they have or the power that they\\n5:27:00\\nhave thanks\\n5:27:09\\nall right next speaker you're on the line hello I'm a Santa Cruz County resident\\n5:27:14\\nstudent at Cabrillo College um I want everyone listening to question\\n5:27:20\\nyourself whether you think the Santa Cruz County Police Department is an institution worthy of your taxes instead\\n5:27:27\\nof giving them more money to arm themselves as weapons to use against us and also the protesters of Oakland which\\n5:27:33\\nwe demand fees immediately we should be using that money to create a more robust system of care and support for homeless\\n5:27:38\\npeople and addicts and to create a team of Crisis responders that resolve conflict without violence I understand\\n5:27:45\\nthat our mayor is working closely with the police to practice reform however you cannot reform A system that is\\n5:27:51\\ninherently violent the criminal justice system is inextricably bound to oppression we cannot solve homelessness\\n5:27:56\\nor addiction by criminalizing it our community needs care not cops Minneapolis is already talking about\\n5:28:02\\ndefunding and understanding their peace I truly believe Santa Cruz would be the perfect place to adopt this model and\\n5:28:07\\nbecome an example for the rest of California we deserve the chance to dream of something better and we can be\\n5:28:12\\nbetter Santa Cruz is amazing and I have faith in us thank you very much\\n5:28:19\\nyep\\n5:28:25\\nall right next speaker hello thank you for having me my name is Carolina Mejia I'm a long time resident\\n5:28:32\\nhere I'm also a student at Cabrillo College um I agree with the idea of a special\\n5:28:37\\nmeeting to talk about black black lives matter and the whole movement but I also agree that with the um budget there\\n5:28:44\\nshould be so much more money poured into minority um education as a first generation high\\n5:28:51\\nschool graduate I attend Rio College I'm a daughter of a single mother I'm a minority and a woman I was denied a long\\n5:28:58\\ntime ago in the public school system as an elementary school student the right to have a proper education I actually\\n5:29:04\\nhad to leave the system to be able to achieve the same goals that I'm achieving today so I really would want\\n5:29:12\\nyou guys to consider putting investing so much more money into the education for minority students so that we can\\n5:29:19\\ntogether grow as a community and grow in equal education because it's a human\\n5:29:24\\nright um is that pension choose between food on their table and educating their\\n5:29:32\\nchildren thank you yep\\n5:29:40\\nokay next speaker uh hi my name's Adam I live in the city\\n5:29:46\\nof Santa Cruz uh and I'm calling to ask you to agendize uh reducing the funding\\n5:29:53\\nfor or even eliminating the Santa Cruz City Police Department\\n5:29:58\\num we can give the important work that the police does to other City departments we can maybe not give anyone\\n5:30:06\\nthe task of running around the city hassling the homeless we could maybe spend the extra money we saved not doing\\n5:30:12\\nthat on housing homeless uh and I just don't feel comfortable\\n5:30:18\\nhaving the city employing people who are authorized to kill in my name thank you\\n5:30:30\\nall right next speaker\\n5:30:43\\nnot sure if they just dropped off the line\\n5:30:49\\nI was in person McKenna Manas\\n5:30:55\\nsorry I also called in my phone and then you I got to talk there so thank you okay thanks\\n5:31:07\\nall right next speaker\\n5:31:16\\nyeah you're on the line oh hello my name is Keith I'm a long time resident here in Santa Cruz um I\\n5:31:22\\nwould like to call a meeting about uh the red distribution of the uh of the\\n5:31:27\\nbudget in Santa Cruz um I feel that uh having the police\\n5:31:32\\ndepartment taking up as much of the budget as libraries Public Works and economic development\\n5:31:38\\num combined I think that that needs to be uh looked closer at um there's a\\n5:31:45\\nthere's a memory that a lot of the students here Santa Cruz have um during the cola\\n5:31:51\\ndemonstrations with police showing up um and breaking a young man's hand and\\n5:31:59\\nsmacking a young woman on the skull with a baton so viral photos of police kneeling with\\n5:32:05\\nus feels more like a stunt and we want to be involved in um their process thank\\n5:32:11\\nyou thank you\\n5:32:18\\nokay next caller you're on the line hello can you hear me yeah hi I just wanted to call to say\\n5:32:26\\nabsolutely ridiculous that the Santa Cruz Police Department is receiving 30 million dollars per year\\n5:32:33\\num which is 34 of the total budget I really think that we should be investing\\n5:32:38\\nin issues such as homelessness housing and for sure climate change um and I know that the budget for\\n5:32:44\\nclimate change projects which would be investing in our future which is super important to me as a young person to\\n5:32:50\\nprotect our future generations and the City of Santa Cruz um they get like thirty thousand dollars\\n5:32:57\\na year from the general fund and I think that is an insane contrast compared to 30 million dollars for the police\\n5:33:02\\ndepartment so please please please defund them or at least bring it down a substantial amount thank you thank you\\n5:33:20\\nhey next speaker thank you\\n5:33:26\\nplease turn down your device sorry about that um I just want to say my name is Devin rainwater I'm a resident and\\n5:33:32\\nstudent in Santa Cruz and I want to say to be a police officer is a personal and willful choice and it is a job that can\\n5:33:38\\nbe easily left um officer safety is not discussing the black lives matter movement because it\\n5:33:44\\nis not at risk people who are at risk are by puck folks targeted by years of\\n5:33:49\\nsystemic racism officers are trained for a very small amount of time to be violent and all cops participate in a\\n5:33:56\\nfundamentally racist system we must defund the scpd and instead fund public education housing support and mental\\n5:34:04\\nhealth services that will reduce crime in the city\\n5:34:10\\nI hope to see my community safe and this means I want to see an abolition of the police\\n5:34:15\\nthank you\\n5:34:23\\nAnnex speaker hello my name is Anna adanski\\n5:34:30\\nGeorgetown County Mental Health for the last few years mostly the homeless population and substance abusers so\\n5:34:38\\nbeing inside of that system I think that something that's been happening with the police recently\\n5:34:44\\nI think that it makes a lot of sense for Santa Cruz County to funnel some of their funds instead to\\n5:34:51\\npreventative care and mental health care\\n5:34:57\\nuh housing and food Justice I think that we could take away some of the funding\\n5:35:03\\nthat's going towards tasers batons and outdated things that are police probably don't\\n5:35:09\\nneed um I'd like to see strangleholds not be used by famous police and overall I'd\\n5:35:16\\njust like to see the finances be funded and reinvested into the care of our communities rather than the policing of\\n5:35:23\\nour communities oh yeah Mental Health Training for our\\n5:35:29\\npolice my brother's a police officer so I know these you know hardcore anti-police but I think I\\n5:35:35\\nthe escalation anti-racial anti-racist training for mental health training\\n5:35:41\\nthank you\\n5:35:47\\nhey I'm the one hi my name is Remy and I'm here to\\n5:35:53\\ndiscuss a majority of the calls that the police receive are\\n5:36:00\\num about the homeless population which they are not trained to properly deal with funds need to be reallocated to\\n5:36:07\\nmental health and Addiction Services education and housing the funding needs\\n5:36:12\\nto be reallocated to support our most vulnerable communities thank you\\n5:36:18\\nthank you\\n5:36:24\\nall right I would like to bring to the campus\\n5:36:30\\nattention the urgency of proposal to create a mural on Front Street to show where we stand on black lives\\n5:36:36\\nmatter and I would also like to support everyone else in defunding the Santa Cruz Police Department and relocating\\n5:36:42\\nfunds to education climate change and housing\\n5:36:48\\nthank you\\n5:36:57\\nhi can you hear me yes good evening hi I'm Lane Edwards I'm a resident of\\n5:37:04\\nSanta Cruz County I actually moved here a couple years ago from New Orleans and one thing that I was extremely struck by\\n5:37:11\\nsimilarly to many of my fellow community members is that our police are extremely overfunded from New Orleans a city that\\n5:37:19\\nhas a much more violent crime they actually have a lower percentage of their cities General funds that go to\\n5:37:26\\nthe police 88 of crime in Santa Cruz according to the city website is\\n5:37:31\\nnon-violent property crime I think we all know why this crime has to happen people are not given the housing they\\n5:37:39\\nare not giving the resources and the care they need to live I believe that our City's funds would be much better\\n5:37:44\\nand much more humanely used to house the homeless and to provide Youth Care over funding the police I strongly suggest\\n5:37:51\\nlike my community members that we hold a specific budget meaning about defunding\\n5:37:56\\nthe police and call that we do progressively slash um beginning with 50\\n5:38:01\\ndefund the police and with the goal of understanding the police thank you so much [Music]\\n5:38:16\\nagain if you wanted to speak during oral Communications you must press on your phone in order to raise your\\n5:38:23\\nhand and I think the next person should be on one\\n5:38:28\\nhi is that mean yep hi so I have a few concerns first off last month's a 21 year old black man\\n5:38:35\\nnamed tamario Smith was found alone dead in his jail cell and the cause of death has still not been released\\n5:38:41\\nwhen someone dies in The care of a public safety department the cause of death needs to be public information to hold those departments accountable\\n5:38:48\\num second my friend's 15 year old son was recently riding his bike home from Pleasure Point in his wetsuit with a\\n5:38:55\\nboogie board when he was pulled over by Santa Cruz sheriff's officer who tried to get him in trouble for being at the\\n5:39:01\\nbeach during the closure as I hope you know the water has remained open for surfing and Boogie boarding during this\\n5:39:07\\nclosure and my friend's son was not breaking any rules in the middle of the stop the scso officer had to actually\\n5:39:13\\nGoogle the law that he was trying to enforce and as you know scso is enforcing the beach closures in South\\n5:39:20\\nCounty beaches and this racial profiling is an embarrassing reflection of the carelessness that police in Santa Cruz\\n5:39:26\\nexhibit on way too many of their law enforcement contacts so please define consider defunding scpd thank you\\n5:39:44\\nall right next speaker\\n5:39:49\\nhello this is Ryan MSC oh that was just me I\\n5:39:58\\njust spoke apparently thank you yeah\\n5:40:04\\nokay next speaker I think this is Melanie Jones\\n5:40:15\\nokay I'm gonna move on to the next speaker I think\\n5:40:22\\nhi um I'm a resident and homeowner here um and I wanted to address the request\\n5:40:28\\nby the scpd for an additional 467 thousand dollars for the next fiscal year I think that we can all agree that\\n5:40:35\\nover the course of the past few weeks the world has really woken up to this issue of over policing on how so many of\\n5:40:40\\nsociety's most pressing problems which have the potential to be addressed and rectified are instead being policed\\n5:40:48\\nCrews already account for the Lion's Share of our budget so rather than just approve another request for more funding\\n5:40:53\\nwhy not use this particular moment in time this active Global wake-up moment to stop and reflect on how that 460\\n5:41:00\\nGrand might be better spent other communities that have taken the approach of investing more heavily in Social Services and scaling back on police have\\n5:41:07\\nultimately decreased crime saved taxpayer dollars and elevated human potential given the police have already\\n5:41:13\\nreceived more than two and a half million dollars in additional budget since 2019 right now just seems like the\\n5:41:18\\nideal moment to pause on approving yet another increase and instead step back and address how we can better invest in\\n5:41:24\\nour community making Santa Cruz an even better place to live for all thank you [Music]\\n5:41:30\\nhere [Music]\\n5:41:36\\nlooks like we got\\n5:41:41\\n13 people who have their hands that want to speak and sell we'll just give people a minute each for these last 13 and then\\n5:41:48\\nwe're going to move on to our evening item\\n5:41:53\\nokay next week you're online hello this is Elizabeth Clifton Doolin\\n5:41:59\\nI'm a Santa Cruz City resident a long time Community member of 40 years I support\\n5:42:07\\nthe Santa Cruz City Police Department under the direction of Andy Mills I\\n5:42:12\\nthink it is that they need to continue funding and they've done a beautiful job in\\n5:42:19\\nde-escalating their staff and keeping us all protected thank you Santa\\n5:42:26\\nCruz Police Department yes\\n5:42:39\\nall right next speaker hi my name is Jennifer teschler and I've lived in the west side of Phoenix for\\n5:42:45\\nseven years I also want a special Santa Cruz and like many people I was upset to learn that 28 of the operating\\n5:42:52\\nbudget goes to the police in our city and that they're asking for even more money especially given them pending\\n5:42:57\\ndeficit brought by covid I'd like to urge the council to vote against the proposed budget increases the center of office and sepd\\n5:43:03\\ninstead we allocate current funding towards services that support our community such as housing education and Parks and Rec other cities are adopting\\n5:43:10\\nthis model as they are confronted with this disproportionate violence inflicted by the police on blast indigenous people\\n5:43:15\\nof color and we should not be the last to follow I am a white woman who's allowed to feel safe in Santa Cruz but many of my bike peers do not to the\\n5:43:22\\npoint that several have fled the cities I will be tracking how the council members vote on this issue and from how\\n5:43:27\\nI spend my votes in the next election I'd also like to add perhaps council person schoolers refrain to making\\n5:43:33\\ncosmographic remarks like I don't know how to talk about this I'm not a stoner and it's sitting here educate themselves or not speak about things they don't\\n5:43:39\\nknow how to talk about thank you for your time\\n5:43:49\\nall right next speaker hi can you hear me yep good evening\\n5:43:57\\ngood evening um my name is Cassandra Powell um and I just wanted to address the\\n5:44:03\\nSanta Cruz Police Department's social media as a social media manager by trade\\n5:44:10\\nfive days ago there was a post called A Tale of Two protests in which\\n5:44:17\\nthe Santa Cruz Police Department on their Facebook Twitter Instagram and on\\n5:44:22\\nthe city website said that the violent protest\\n5:44:28\\num was led by UCSC grad students but that is not at all true\\n5:44:33\\num and is a blatant Act of defamation and um really trying to divide uh our\\n5:44:42\\ncommunity and is a clearly unfounded and blatant attack on our own citizens\\n5:44:48\\num so I'm just calling for the police to do better and to like find their sources and uh really\\n5:44:56\\nuse their power on social media for the good of the community especially um because that Viral photo of the chief\\n5:45:03\\nofficer and you may are coming um has increased their follower count by a lot\\n5:45:10\\nthank you very much yeah\\n5:45:20\\nokay next speaker can you hear me\\n5:45:25\\ngood evening good evening my name Linda I'm your resident of Santa Cruz County and I just\\n5:45:31\\nwanted to say that I support creating a special session to discuss the police\\n5:45:37\\ndepartment funding and reallocation of funds to more Community supportive associations and taking some of the\\n5:45:44\\nresponsibilities that are placed on police and creating alternative departments to address the issues that\\n5:45:51\\ncould be raised without um forced and I also would like to say that\\n5:45:57\\nI support the initiatives to do a mural or the black lives matter movement on\\n5:46:03\\nFront Street thank you\\n5:46:13\\nall right next speaker hello my name is Elizabeth I'm a\\n5:46:18\\nresident of Santa Cruz I want to first take a moment for all the lives that have been lost recently\\n5:46:24\\num from police brutality from the protest or from covid um and then I just want to\\n5:46:30\\nsupport all the calls that have been made to refund and reallocate the\\n5:46:35\\nresources that are going towards the police um I think that Santa Cruz deserves to\\n5:46:42\\nbe a safe and fair place for everybody not just those white wealthy residents\\n5:46:47\\nand in making the meeting to make these\\n5:46:53\\nbudgetary changes that is concretely showing the residents of color that the\\n5:46:58\\nSanta Cruz City Council carers and is committed to eradicating the racism that does exist\\n5:47:05\\nhere and that affects the lives of everybody especially those residents of\\n5:47:11\\ncolor thank you\\n5:47:21\\nhello hello I'm on hi thanks for taking my call my name is\\n5:47:27\\nMel I'm a Santa Cruz resident and I want to address the proposed increase to the police budget it doesn't make any sense\\n5:47:33\\nto me as well as many other community community members who have stated in this meeting why we would increase the\\n5:47:39\\npolice department budget to a proposed 28 of our budget which would be more than multiple sectors combined the\\n5:47:46\\npolice which historically started as slave Patrol in the south is entrenched in systematic racism I know you all know\\n5:47:53\\nwhat that means I know you know what that means black and brown people are racially profiled in Santa Cruz all the\\n5:47:58\\ntime we also demand that you immediately stop sending the Santa Cruz Police Department to participate in egregious\\n5:48:05\\nviolence against against protesters in Oakland this is this is just wrong and I know y'all know that and you have the power\\n5:48:11\\nto do something the answer is to defund the police and work towards abolishing the police so that we can truly invest\\n5:48:18\\nin community-based Solutions we demand that you call a meeting to address reducing funding for the police\\n5:48:25\\nbe on the side of Justice on the police do not doubt that we are all watching to see how you show up or fail to show up\\n5:48:31\\nfor justice thank you\\n5:48:39\\nall right next speaker on the line Santa Cruz is a Paradise Beach City\\n5:48:45\\nkissed by the Pacific Ocean Breeze and hugged by the Redwood Forest\\n5:48:51\\nthe city also has a long history of racism that spawns from the oppression of the native peoples to the Daily\\n5:48:57\\nharassment or worse of its current non-whites listen to the voices of your people\\n5:49:04\\nthey have overwhelmingly spoken you fill the city with more police action you fill the city with the image of a town\\n5:49:10\\nout of control and who wants to vacation or go to college or buy their house in a heavily policed municipality people\\n5:49:19\\nlike Justin Bieber vacation in the area because of the giant Dipper not the giant Police Department you have artists\\n5:49:26\\nEducators innovators and passionate population to whom you can direct funding to come up with the solutions\\n5:49:32\\nneeded to make Santa Cruz the amazing place it's always meant to be\\n5:49:39\\nthe choice is yours you may not have long to make it because the people will speak out and act out against you\\n5:49:46\\nthis is black [Music]\\n5:49:54\\nspeaker hi can you hear me yes good evening\\n5:50:00\\nhello my name is Nicholas church I was born and raised in Santa Cruz County I'm calling for a defunding and of the\\n5:50:08\\npolice department taking up 28 of budget more than Library Public Works and\\n5:50:13\\neconomic development and ludicrous I'm truly appalled that we would Center Police Department to Oakland to enforce\\n5:50:20\\nsystemic racism we claim to be one of the most liberal places in California let alone the country we need to act\\n5:50:25\\nlike it become a Cornerstone for redefining how a community could be protected\\n5:50:31\\nthe if you do not act if you do not work\\n5:50:36\\ntowards the allocating resources we will see it you are under a microscope now\\n5:50:44\\nact on it I yield my time\\n5:50:53\\nforeign hi my name is Avatar Joshi and I'd like\\n5:50:59\\nto thank the council members for taking my call I've lived in Santa Cruz for the past five years and I've been a\\n5:51:04\\nhomeowner for the past two years and I'm calling about the use of excessive force by the police department Across the\\n5:51:10\\nNation and I know that in city of Santa Cruz that a significant portion of the city's operating budget goes to the\\n5:51:16\\npolice department the sepd uses more Force for arrest than 23 percent of other police departments in California\\n5:51:21\\nand the excessive use of force has even been used against peaceful protesters peaceful student protesters on the\\n5:51:28\\ncampus of UC Santa Cruz during the cola movement and this is absolutely unacceptable I would like to urge the\\n5:51:35\\ncouncil to vote against the proposed budget increases to the Sheriff's Office and the svpd and instead reallocates\\n5:51:42\\ntheir current funding towards services that support our community such as housing and Health Department education\\n5:51:48\\nParks and Rec and Public Works other cities are adopting this model as they're confronting the disproportion of\\n5:51:54\\nviolence reflected by the police on black indigenous and people of color and\\n5:51:59\\nwe should not be the last to follow I'll be following how the council members vote and I intend to use this issue to\\n5:52:07\\ninform how I vote in the next elections thank you very much for taking my call\\n5:52:12\\nyep all right next speaker\\n5:52:19\\nhello I am also calling to encourage you to put defunding the police on your next\\n5:52:25\\nagenda or to call a special meeting um I agree with everyone that the way we're treating homeless people in this\\n5:52:31\\ncounty is atrocious and we really should be using money that's currently going to\\n5:52:39\\nmostly harass homeless people it feels like to support them and to address the\\n5:52:45\\nhousing affordability crisis thanks y'all\\n5:52:58\\nPhoenix speaker hi my name is Ashley I've lived in Santa Cruz for 23 years as the world grapples\\n5:53:05\\nwith tough and necessary decisions about systemic racism policing\\n5:53:12\\nand funding communities I believe it's far past time Santa Cruz does something in all part of this stop sending our\\n5:53:17\\npolice to terrorize other communities why is Santa Cruz allowing their cops to go and trample other communities\\n5:53:25\\nright to the free of speech we must end these Mutual Aid agreements sccd's\\n5:53:30\\nbudget budgets going to be more than the economic development Community Development and Public Works combined\\n5:53:36\\nwith housing crisis climate change at our front door and a pandemic in our hands we must think progressively and\\n5:53:42\\nspending money money for forward change I hope that the council takes us to heart and will push for official time\\n5:53:48\\nfor a community to express in depth their concerns and their hopes for a future of this city and take a closer\\n5:53:55\\nlook at the proposed increase sbcd's budget and see that if the money would be spent better elsewhere thank you\\n5:54:02\\ngive\\n5:54:09\\nall right next speaker hi my name is Veronica Varner\\n5:54:14\\nI'm frankly appalled by the proposal to a lot 28.1 percent of the budget towards policing these budget increases are\\n5:54:20\\nclearly not investing back into our community the one million dollar budget to alleviate homelessness one of the most pressing issues in Santa Cruz\\n5:54:27\\nespecially during the time of covid-19 pales in comparison as was only eight an\\n5:54:32\\neight hundred thousand dollar budget for project room key in Santa Cruz there are 1 204 individuals experiencing\\n5:54:38\\nhomelessness with a whopping 78 unsheltered in Santa Cruz with only 150 grams allotted by project green case\\n5:54:45\\nwith the city spending 17 million of City resources towards quote reacting to the impact of homelessness it is clear\\n5:54:52\\nthat more policing is not going to fix the issue we must reallocate funds towards affordable housing shelters\\n5:54:57\\nRehabilitation programs related to drugs or mental illness the city is currently burning through money an abusive cycle\\n5:55:04\\nof arrest and release with its population experiencing homelessness and the criminalization of this population\\n5:55:09\\nbreak the chain reallocate

criminal logical\\n5:59:48\\nresearch on the causes of crime has shown that at least in part crime\\n5:59:57\\noccurs in um because pockets of\\n6:00:02\\nconcentrated disadvantage deny people opportunities to participate\\n6:00:08\\nin community in their Greater Community and uh\\n6:00:15\\ninvest there for investing in community works and programs that\\n6:00:21\\ncenter community Advocates from within these neighborhoods is a way to\\n6:00:28\\nlower crime rates therefore\\n6:00:34\\nthe need for highly militarized police forces which in fact incite violence as\\n6:00:39\\nwe

that I turned in a petition4:57:19to the mayor uh Wednesday of this week I thought it would be in time to be on the4:57:25agenda uh the essence of the petition is that it's time for the public to be back4:57:33in front of the council uh could be done at the Civic Auditorium I turned in uh4:57:3841 wet signatures I thought it was important to do this in person in person and not by internet I have

Electronics4:58:04thank you sir thank you4:58:13all right next speaker you're online hi this is Scott Graham I was calling about4:58:19the zoo meeting that the mayor and the chief of police had4:58:25at the during that meeting when questions were taken from the public4:58:32police answered everyone's questions except mine and I sent him an email CeCe4:58:39the mayor and other council members about this the questions were4:58:44demilitarizing the police racial profiling was being done about it4:58:50use of force guidelines who can fire a bad cop can the city manager fire a bad4:58:58cop or is it only just this chief of police or can the city council go into4:59:03special session and fire a bad cop um more non-lethal options like in Japan4:59:11they have these net guns that they can shoot a net over somebody that'll trip them up and uh4:59:19mobile demobilize them um what are we going to do about the endless harassment of the poorest4:59:26members of our society and then uh we need to bring back a4:59:32police review board and a police review board that has some teeth not a cute toothless one like the one that was4:59:39around before now the other issue is the zoom meetings these Zoom meetings are terrible4:59:45half of the uh what is being said is unintelligible4:59:51Cynthia Matthews has the worst connection of anybody I can barely4:59:57understand anything she says on here and I don't you know it's probably not her5:00:02fault to some fault of whatever device she's using or her internet connection I5:00:08don't know but we've gotta like Lee

soon as possible I know that because it's difficult so that's pretty much but this5:01:18sort of gathering necessarily it's more of a protest it supports of black lives5:01:23matter by artists and the approval and supportive of government and I think it shows where the Santa Cruz Community5:01:28stands um it's for instance those as well as really a call to action for racial5:01:34Equity practices the implemented in places in our community where they're not perfect5:01:40great thank you5:01:47online hi there my name is Jace Richie uh thank5:01:54you for taking my call um over the last hour and a half about5:02:01um I've gotten to hear a lot of the priorities of what this uh community and5:02:06the city council value and it's been frustrating to know that the public5:02:12commentary which was set to begin an hour and a half ago is pushed to now but I am grateful for the opportunity to5:02:19hear that like myself in a number of my friends and colleagues5:02:24the city council members care deeply about the people of5:02:31the vet they can consider that When developing in more detail as a budget to5:02:38commit to defunding the police department of Santa Cruz a police department that is known5:02:46for and has a history of violence against black and brown people and a5:02:54city that needs to reinvest public infrastructure in things like affordable housing5:03:02all right thank you5:03:09Phoenix call you one minute hi my name is Chrissy Hansen mayor5:03:15Cummings and City Council Members most of you know me my husband is a Santa5:03:20Cruz police officer and I'm calling to implore you to please do not defund or reallocate any money that is allocated5:03:27for the police department it is of utmost importance for officer safety and5:03:33Community safety as you all know we just lost Sergeant butzweiler my husband was5:03:38there during that incident and it brings it home that these officers men and women5:03:44all over our County put their hearts and souls into their jobs we all know there5:03:50are bad apples in every single job out there but the men and women of the Santa5:03:55Cruz Police Department put their hearts and souls into their jobs and they try to do the best they possibly can for our5:04:01community it really truly boils down to officer safety and Community safety and I5:04:08implore you to look into doing research in other states and states and countries5:04:15who have defunded or reallocated money and see what the consequences have been we already have this catch and released5:04:22and our did a lot of hats please do not defend5:04:28the police department thank you so much for your time thank you5:04:36all right next speaker okay this is Garrett Phillip the writers5:04:41the arsonists the looters and the anarchists and all of those who want to hijack George Floyd's family's5:04:47legitimate demand for justice to further their own personal agendas of division chaos and violence should be condemned5:04:55and stopped he sure was a victim of a deadly civil rights righteous officer of that city5:05:01government notice I say deadly civil rights abuse and not systemic racism the5:05:06outrage should be the same regardless of race and concentrated on government civil rights abuses5:05:13and restoring accountability for all government actions needs Focus instead of the inflammatory leftist knee jerk5:05:19claim of systematic racism which would raise more than accusations and statistics the Lloyd response reminds me5:05:26of the last credible protest of abuse at the hands of the powerful namely Occupy Wall Street where their message of5:05:32criminal banking fraud got delegitimatized forgotten and then crushed by the delusion of the hordes5:05:37have left a special agenda grievance bongers inappropriately trying to hijack that Financial abuse issue for their own5:05:43agendas the result was no reform in the now dare I say we are seeing the BLM the5:05:49anarchists the looters the Vandals terrorists antifa the national dirty code tactician press and political5:05:56parties taking Focus away from the central issue of an unaccountable government abuse of power for their own5:06:02purposes kind of risking another failure or probably worse they might succeed in5:06:08destroying Society thanks bye thank you5:06:18all right next speaker you're on the line hi my name is Edith I'm a Santa Cruz resident I want to First acknowledge5:06:25that we are on the unseated territory of mamamutu I acknowledge the voices in the community that are asking for abolishment of the police in solidarity5:06:31with the black lives matter movement according to the city budget proposal scpd is asking for over 400 000 more the5:06:36next fiscal year which is grand total increased over 3 million since 2019. as the city must cut costs due to covid-195:06:42we must focus our budget on care and resources not surveillance and state violence according to police5:06:48scorecard.org fcpd uses more Force batons tasers and strangleholds per arrests and 23 percent of police5:06:54departments in California that is both a physical and mental cost of violence and to error terror on our community as well5:07:00as the monetary cost of those weapons if we really want to save money and the work of our community stop sending local5:07:05police to other communities such as Oak lift if we want to build a better Santa Cruz postcoded disarm scpd instead of5:07:11funding their pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms tasers tear gas and riot gear to use on protesters to have5:07:16been peaceful so far direct that money to our house as community members our families and our students who needed a5:07:21lot more than white homeowners need a sense of safety provided by the legacy of the

comment um item number 16 and for some reason my star nine didn't hit5:08:03so just real briefly there's an issue there I know it was already passed on second meeting but5:08:09um that's the uh mandatory involuntary election contribution limits and it's5:08:15unclear whether that applies in recall candidate elections as we just had5:08:21because there this year with this last recall and I don't want to relive the past it's over5:08:26but um the I think that you should make it clear whether they intent of that is to apply5:08:34to recall candidates as well because there was a violation if it was5:08:40thank you very much thank you5:08:46all right next speaker you're online5:08:54all right uh the next speaker I am Vice chair of the Santa Cruz Arts5:09:01Commission uh first thank you for your time I would like to bring to your attention uh an5:09:08application for a permit uh presented by Abby Mustafa for a special event held on5:09:16Front Street that is a mural for black lives matter5:09:21um I believe this requires immediate attention from the council and once5:09:27again thank you for everything5:09:42hello hello yeah I'm Ron my name is Peter5:09:49Binky I live in Santa Cruz I've been a resident here since 2014. I want to begin by saying that we are in the5:09:54unseated territory of up Indians represented by the ominous and tribal bands that black lives matter and5:10:00although I will never understand the black experience of racism I stand with black people and people of color5:10:06I would like to spend my experience and thought on the conduct and priorities5:10:12I've worked as a security guard in Santa Cruz since 2015 beginning at the Crow's Nest and the Blue Lagoon until 2018 and5:10:19from 2018 the president at Brady's Yacht Club in the time I have had to handle stabbings drive-by shootings assaults5:10:25and talkative people and survive with minimal harm to myself and no harm to others on April 20th 2018 I was attacked and5:10:33assaulted for being gay a stranger assaulted me out of nowhere inside the AC referring to me as a I am a gay5:10:40man after leaving the house see my assailant with some other attack myself and a friend5:10:45I had to call this cpv three times over two days to get someone to take a statement I was told they were very busy5:10:52and put them to be immediately that this was not a priority I understand that there are more important issues in the5:10:58hate crime but I feel that it should be a priority after a month I finally had a follow-up5:11:03there was video evidence of the assault that that was it other than a letter saying you're the victim of a crime I'm5:11:10going to stop you thank you for providing us with that information and let us know if we can follow up with you5:11:15on uh suggesting that sounds like a pretty serious concern thank you for calling in5:11:22hey all right Mr Speaker hi there I just wanted I just wanted to reach out as a born and5:11:29raised resident of Santa Cruz to just address the allocation of our tax dollars and policing in our community5:11:35um with kova 19 City staffers have been recommending that we like cut upwards to six million dollars in spending and I5:11:42think it's about the time that the city looks at how much spending is going into the police department and how much we're actually5:11:48getting out of it as a community I to reevaluate the city's Financial relationship with policing in ways that5:11:55like like there's uh in ways like making officers um liable for misconduct settlements and5:12:01not taxpayers from withholding pensions and we're not hires who are involved with excessive5:12:07boards and abuse uh claims as well as spending paid leave for costs who are under investigation but I think it's5:12:13really really important that we just stop sending our police to terrorize other communities I don't know why Santa5:12:19Cruz is allowing their cops to go and trample on another community's right to pre-spread free speech like that system5:12:26like wrong side of History stuff I really think we need to end Aid agreement5:12:32um you know our city doesn't mirror large urban areas but um find themselves assaulted with militarized police forces5:12:37Santa Cruz has in many ways already been a leading example of what a community-led resource could be but I5:12:44think it's far from good enough and I hope that the council takes this to heart and will push for official time5:12:49for the community to express and that's their concerns thank you5:12:56all right next speaker yeah hi my name's Al and I really5:13:02appreciate everything you guys do I know it's a hard job first of all I wanted to say that the events that happened over5:13:08the weekend with the murder of the deputy sheriff Damon gotzwell has really shaken us all up here5:13:14um and it it happens 250 days after one5:13:19of my best friends tusharate was also kidnapped and murdered from his home in pleasure points and5:13:25um both with senseless acts of violence um and uh I I've I've been here in Santa5:13:31Cruz for a few years and it's been a shock to us that the level of violence here is so high and we believe Annie5:13:39Mills and his chief and and and mayor Justin Cummins thank you so much for your courageous and calming impact on5:13:46during the BLM um riding downtown it showed a level of5:13:51sort of discipline and and Leadership that I hadn't seen before and of course I was in the the marches as well as the5:13:58paddle outs for BLM I support everything that they do but I really urge you do not tap the police in fact if you feel5:14:04like you need to increase it I'm a big supporter of that thank you for everything that you do and we hope we5:14:10can get back to a community with respect love and and all the values that we really appreciate5:14:15thank you all right next speaker you're online5:14:23hi um my name is Josh grobinski I live in Santa Cruz I want to say I'm really saddened by the violence against the5:14:29police this weekend um and I think that there's a way to create a community where the polarization became the police and5:14:35the people um is really different the recent events in Minneapolis and covert crisis create5:14:40an opportunity to think differently and I think a serious look at how we can rethink the kinds of Power police have and use5:14:46we don't need a person with a gun to respond to the vast majority of mental health situations we don't need a person with a gun to deal with a forged 20 Bill5:14:52we don't need a person with a gun to give a speeding ticket we don't need a person with a gun to support homeless people and the list goes on we need5:14:58people trained to deal with difficult and most situations not trained to catch criminals which means that we don't need5:15:04the police in many many many situations we need to defund the police and there's a whole bunch of things we can do I mean5:15:10look at what's happening in Minneapolis so let's be fun to Santa Cruz Police and while we're figuring out how to make that work continuing the hiring free5:15:17zone please right now for police out of Oakland and just notice that if we're spending 30 million dollars with 100 million dollar Budget on the cops that5:15:24is way way too much [Music] foreign5:15:34hi my name is Caitlin Hannah I've been a resident of Santa Cruz for 14 years5:15:40in response to the black lives matter movement and Countrywide calls for defunding the police I expect the5:15:45council to create a special session or an agenda item at the very least on the next meeting with regards to the5:15:51defunding of the scpd and the underfunding of humanitarian and Social Services5:15:57over the year I've witnessed countless hours and dollars spent through the scpd on asking our unhoused population to5:16:05move to move to move to not sit here to not lay down here I feel that that the5:16:11scpd's labor efforts and funds are grossly misused and in need of major reallocation thank you5:16:24all right next caller year online5:16:33hello can you hear me yes how are you my name is Andrew Carlson I'm a local uh5:16:39maker fabricator prototyper and business consultant and I have a budget a bunch5:16:44of budgetary questions I hope I have the right data here um but my understanding is that you're5:16:50asking to cut six million dollars out of the budget and ironically you're asking to increase the police budget to 28.15:16:58percent which would be larger than the library Public Works Economic Development combined5:17:04um and also there's been an insufficient response to Cova especially in terms of PPE my maker lab has actually been5:17:10producing a ton of that and it's not been going well it's about the communities are funded so5:17:17so I'd like to ask why are we not suspending paid admin for cops who are5:17:22under investigation for excessive violence for example and why do we have5:17:2723 higher excessive force when it comes to5:17:33per arrest so 23 higher rate per arrest violence compared to any other PD and5:17:41hopefully anyway I would like to if you find the place thank you [Music]5:17:49thank you very much all right next person you're online5:17:59hi my name is my name is Elena Ramer I want to demand5:18:05the city of Santa Cruz immediately begin a process of defunding the police and begin supporting the needs of our5:18:11communities in ways that will eventually make police obsolete that means housing5:18:16for all health care for all including mental health care and addiction treatment and other services for all who are in5:18:23need it means emergency responders who are not cops and who are trained in Conflict mediation5:18:29who are mental health care providers and social workers the city needs to support and fund marginalized communities in5:18:35Santa Cruz they deserve care not cops doing so will be a baby step towards5:18:40repairing the damage that has been done by over policing police brutality police complicity with ice gentrification and5:18:48the general whitewashing of Santa Cruz history and culture we can't settle for reforms that have been tried and have5:18:53failed in other cities fight for the future we want and deserve while you're at it and cash bail and end Juvenile5:18:59Detention now foreign5:19:13Kessler and I'm a resident of Santa Cruz County thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak I'm asking for the5:19:20council to not approve an increase in budget for the police force and to instead allocate more funds to education5:19:26housing and community-based programs in Santa Cruz I was shocked to learn that5:19:31policium took 12 percent of the city's budget in 2018 while only 1.8 percent5:19:36went to housing I feel strongly that the police force does not need more funding especially since Santa Cruz Police5:19:43Department uses more Force per arrest than 23 percent of other police departments in California5:19:50also be following how each council member votes to determine who I would like to elect in the future as well5:19:55thank you for your time5:20:02hey next speaker hello my name is Jesse Malley I'm 335:20:08year resident here in Santa Cruz California our state and animalism territory I'm calling for the5:20:14reallocation of police funds to man carry and social services and we should not be sending costs to do5:20:22jobs that should be done by social workers thank you very much thank you5:20:31next speaker5:20:37hi um my name is Sabina and I live in Santa Cruz I was born here and I raised my5:20:42kids here I'm a boring middle-aged white mom that is asking you to defund the police5:20:47the police are dangerous they're dangerous to our kids and to our community they treat every situation as5:20:53a hammer because that's the tools that they have why are we giving money to a violent forest and the money could go into the5:20:58community for good the police budget is 28.1 percent of the budget look around5:21:03at how many other areas of our community that could use those funds we could house everyone instead our tax dollars5:21:10in Santa Cruz are going to sbpd backing up police brutality in Oakland we also need to remove the police from our5:21:16schools why are we sending police with guns into our schools I don't want my tax dollars going to that view black5:21:24lives matter5:21:31all right next speaker good evening I'm a resident of Santa Cruz County and a white resident that5:21:37completely supports the black lives matter movement and defunding the police in order to put back the power in the5:21:43hands of the community and put an end to the police brutality experience not only in California but all across the United5:21:48States leasing our community takes up the largest chunk of our City's General operating budget which means more5:21:54funding is going toward policing than Economic Development Library funding and Community Development combined5:22:00thanks to the police score.org and your online SC City budget proposal I want to list out some important numbers5:22:07again a budget deficit of 10 to 20 million due to covid-19 and the sheriff's office is asking for an 85:22:13million dollar increase in the next fiscal year which is completely unacceptable5:22:18before my time is up I'd like to summarize some things that I think we should make a priority in the next meeting deep on the police and allocate5:22:24the money and resources to Oregon Nations that are specialized in various professions such as social workers and medical suspend use of paid admin leave5:22:32for cops under investigation withhold pension from and don't rehire cops involved in excessive force require cops5:22:38to be liable for misconduct settlements not taxpayers withdrawn participation of lease militarization programs and5:22:44Military exercises disarm the sctd no more pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms armored vehicles tasers tear5:22:51gas or riot gear we are people and you are not at war with us thank you for listening5:22:57yep5:23:04all right next speaker good evening everyone my name is Rachel Martinez and I'm a Santa Cruz resident I5:23:11would first like to agree with Caitlin Hannah's request that the council hold a special session for defunding the scpd I5:23:18find it extremely concerning that there's over four hundred thousand dollars proposed for the scpd in the upcoming budget it's embarrassing to be5:23:25living in a city that boasts progressiveness while sending combat ready officers to a historically black community disciple the voices of their5:23:32residents I'm ashamed to live in a city that values a violent and oppressive Police Department over the health and5:23:37safety of their citizens defund our Police Department invest in our community and let Santa Cruz be the5:23:43progressive Haven you all pretend it is thank you thank you5:23:55hi can you hear me yes hey my name is Rachel Chavez I'm at RN5:24:01who's lived in Santa Cruz most my life and I've asked I'm here today to ask you to deep on the police services like5:24:06housing education and Healthcare have been drained of funds that were siphoned off to an increasingly militarized police force Santa Cruz you only have to5:24:13walk around downtown for a minute or so to see the devastating effects of lack of housing in our community in 20185:24:18funding for housing took up only 1.8 percent of the budget Community programs two percent while policing took up 125:24:24percent policing is inherently resistant system in Santa Cruz in 2015 black5:24:30people made up 4.3 percent of all arrests and only 0.9 percent of the total population but Andy Mills will5:24:36tell you that scpd is too enlightened to act in a racist manner this shows either total misunderstanding or an absolute5:24:42refusal to acknowledge how systemic racism is for a petulated in systems but can look to Minneapolis to see that5:24:48police reform is implicit bias trading an equivalent unequivocally do not do enough police still wind up murdering5:24:54black people with impunity [Music] thank you thank you5:25:03hey I'm Milan hi my name is Madison I'm a long-time resident of Santa Cruz5:25:10just wanted to offer my thoughts to our council members as we set priorities for our budget in the upcoming weeks I would5:25:15like to see the city of Santa Cruz adopt a socially responsible budget that prioritizes Health and Welfare spending5:25:21over policing nearly a third of our city General funds are dedicated to policing5:25:26and my understanding that the police have requested a budget increase for the 28-21 fiscal year this request should be5:25:33rejected employees funding should be reallocated toward a Health and Welfare programs reallocating resources would5:25:38protect the most vulnerable in our community as the city reckons with the consequences of decreasing resources to5:25:43meet the essential needs of its residents and I would just like to say if you fail to prioritize people over police in your5:25:49budget considerations not only will I not vote for you when the time comes but I will do everything in my power to help5:25:55replace you with more Progressive Challengers thank you for your time yep5:26:04hello hello5:26:09oh hi um so I'm a downtime resident my name is McKenna5:26:15um and I'm calling to ask that you based on the police because um they're funded too heavily and they're5:26:22trying to pass ordinances like the quality of life ordinance that actually asks uh that is he criminalized to have5:26:28syringes on you without a prescription and other things like camping from 7 A.M to 10 pm and then 10 pm to 7 A.M which5:26:35doesn't make any sense um and yeah I just think the attacking of5:26:41homeless people in this community has gone on for far too long I think it's a waste of our time Santa Cruz PD PR uh5:26:46does more misdemeanor arrests than 98 of police departments of California according to policegorecard.com and yeah5:26:54I would just say just defund the police um we don't need them to have weapons that they have or the power that they5:27:00have thanks5:27:09all right next speaker you're on the line hello I'm a Santa Cruz County resident5:27:14student at Cabrillo College um I want everyone listening to question5:27:20yourself whether you think the Santa Cruz County Police Department is an institution worthy of your taxes instead5:27:27of giving them more money to arm themselves as weapons to use against us and also the protesters of Oakland which5:27:33we demand fees immediately we should be using that money to create a more robust system of care and support for homeless5:27:38people and addicts and to create a team of Crisis responders that resolve conflict without violence I understand5:27:45that our mayor is working closely with the police to practice reform however you cannot reform A system that is5:27:51inherently violent the criminal justice system is inextricably bound to oppression we cannot solve homelessness5:27:56or addiction by criminalizing it our community needs care not cops Minneapolis is already talking about5:28:02defunding and understanding their peace I truly believe Santa Cruz would be the perfect place to adopt this model and5:28:07become an example for the rest of California we deserve the chance to dream of something better and we can be5:28:12better Santa Cruz is amazing and I have faith in us thank you very much5:28:19yep5:28:25all right next speaker hello thank you for having me my name is Carolina Mejia I'm a long time resident5:28:32here I'm also a student at Cabrillo College um I agree with the idea of a special5:28:37meeting to talk about black black lives matter and the whole movement but I also agree that with the um budget there5:28:44should be so much more money poured into minority um education as a first generation high5:28:51school graduate I attend Rio College I'm a daughter of a single mother I'm a minority and a woman I was denied a long5:28:58time ago in the public school system as an elementary school student the right to have a proper education I actually5:29:04had to leave the system to be able to achieve the same goals that I'm achieving today so I really would want5:29:12you guys to consider putting investing so much more money into the education for minority students so that we can5:29:19together grow as a community and grow in equal education because it's a human5:29:24right um is that pension choose between food on their table and educating their5:29:32children thank you yep5:29:40okay next speaker uh hi my name's Adam I live in the city5:29:46of Santa Cruz uh and I'm calling to ask you to agendize uh reducing the funding5:29:53for or even eliminating the Santa Cruz City Police Department5:29:58um we can give the important work that the police does to other City departments we can maybe not give anyone5:30:06the task of running around the city hassling the homeless we could maybe spend the extra money we saved not doing5:30:12that on housing homeless uh and I just don't feel comfortable5:30:18having the city employing people who are authorized to kill in my name thank you5:30:30all right next speaker5:30:43not sure if they just dropped off the line5:30:49I was in person McKenna Manas5:30:55sorry I also called in my phone and then you I got to talk there so thank you okay thanks5:31:07all right next speaker5:31:16yeah you're on the line oh hello my name is Keith I'm a long time resident here in Santa Cruz um I5:31:22would like to call a meeting about uh the red distribution of the uh of the5:31:27budget in Santa Cruz um I feel that uh having the police5:31:32department taking up as much of the budget as libraries Public Works and economic development5:31:38um combined I think that that needs to be uh looked closer at um there's a5:31:45there's a memory that a lot of the students here Santa Cruz have um during the cola5:31:51demonstrations with police showing up um and breaking a young man's hand and5:31:59smacking a young woman on the skull with a baton so viral photos of police kneeling with5:32:05us feels more like a stunt and we want to be involved in um their process thank5:32:11you thank you5:32:18okay next caller you're on the line hello can you hear me yeah hi I just wanted to call to say5:32:26absolutely ridiculous that the Santa Cruz Police Department is receiving 30 million dollars per year5:32:33um which is 34 of the total budget I really think that we should be investing5:32:38in issues such as homelessness housing and for sure climate change um and I know that the budget for5:32:44climate change projects which would be investing in our future which is super important to me as a young person to5:32:50protect our future generations and the City of Santa Cruz um they get like thirty thousand dollars5:32:57a year from the general fund and I think that is an insane contrast compared to 30 million dollars for the police5:33:02department so please please please defund them or at least bring it down a substantial amount thank you thank you5:33:20hey next speaker thank you5:33:26please turn down your device sorry about that um I just want to say my name is Devin rainwater I'm a resident and5:33:32student in Santa Cruz and I want to say to be a police officer is a personal and willful choice and it is a job that can5:33:38be easily left um officer safety is not discussing the black lives matter movement because it5:33:44is not at risk people who are at risk are by puck folks targeted by years of5:33:49systemic racism officers are trained for a very small amount of time to be violent and all cops participate in a5:33:56fundamentally racist system we must defund the scpd and instead fund public education housing support and mental5:34:04health services that will reduce crime in the city5:34:10I hope to see my community safe and this means I want to see an abolition of the police5:34:15thank you5:34:23Annex speaker hello my name is Anna adanski5:34:30Georgetown County Mental Health for the last few years mostly the homeless population and substance abusers so5:34:38being inside of that system I think that something that's been happening with the police recently5:34:44I think that it makes a lot of sense for Santa Cruz County to funnel some of their funds instead to5:34:51preventative care and mental health care5:34:57uh housing and food Justice I think that we could take away some of the funding5:35:03that's going towards tasers batons and outdated things that are police probably don't5:35:09need um I'd like to see strangleholds not be used by famous police and overall I'd5:35:16just like to see the finances be funded and reinvested into the care of our communities rather than the policing of5:35:23our communities oh yeah Mental Health Training for our5:35:29police my brother's a police officer so I know these you know hardcore anti-police but I think I5:35:35the escalation anti-racial anti-racist training for mental health training5:35:41thank you5:35:47hey I'm the one hi my name is Remy and I'm here to5:35:53discuss a majority of the calls that the police receive are5:36:00um about the homeless population which they are not trained to properly deal with funds need to be reallocated to5:36:07mental health and Addiction Services education and housing the funding needs5:36:12to be reallocated to support our most vulnerable communities thank you5:36:18thank you5:36:24all right I would like to bring to the campus5:36:30attention the urgency of proposal to create a mural on Front Street to show where we stand on black lives5:36:36matter and I would also like to support everyone else in defunding the Santa Cruz Police Department and relocating5:36:42funds to education climate change and housing5:36:48thank you5:36:57hi can you hear me yes good evening hi I'm Lane Edwards I'm a resident of5:37:04Santa Cruz County I actually moved here a couple years ago from New Orleans and one thing that I was extremely struck by5:37:11similarly to many of my fellow community members is that our police are extremely overfunded from New Orleans a city that5:37:19has a much more violent crime they actually have a lower percentage of their cities General funds that go to5:37:26the police 88 of crime in Santa Cruz according to the city website is5:37:31non-violent property crime I think we all know why this crime has to happen people are not given the housing they5:37:39are not giving the resources and the care they need to live I believe that our City's funds would be much better5:37:44and much more humanely used to house the homeless and to provide Youth Care over funding the police I strongly suggest5:37:51like my community members that we hold a specific budget meaning about defunding5:37:56the police and call that we do progressively slash um beginning with 505:38:01defund the police and with the goal of understanding the police thank you so much [Music]5:38:16again if you wanted to speak during oral Communications you must press on your phone in order to raise your5:38:23hand and I think the next person should be on one5:38:28hi is that mean yep hi so I have a few concerns first off last month's a 21 year old black man5:38:35named tamario Smith was found alone dead in his jail cell and the cause of death has still not been released5:38:41when someone dies in The care of a public safety department the cause of death needs to be public information to hold those departments accountable5:38:48um second my friend's 15 year old son was recently riding his bike home from Pleasure Point in his wetsuit with a5:38:55boogie board when he was pulled over by Santa Cruz sheriff's officer who tried to get him in trouble for being at the5:39:01beach during the closure as I hope you know the water has remained open for surfing and Boogie boarding during this5:39:07closure and my friend's son was not breaking any rules in the middle of the stop the scso officer had to actually5:39:13Google the law that he was trying to enforce and as you know scso is enforcing the beach closures in South5:39:20County beaches and this racial profiling is an embarrassing reflection of the carelessness that police in Santa Cruz5:39:26exhibit on way too many of their law enforcement contacts so please define consider defunding scpd thank you5:39:44all right next speaker5:39:49hello this is Ryan MSC oh that was just me I5:39:58just spoke apparently thank you yeah5:40:04okay next speaker I think this is Melanie Jones5:40:15okay I'm gonna move on to the next speaker I think5:40:22hi um I'm a resident and homeowner here um and I wanted to address the request5:40:28by the scpd for an additional 467 thousand dollars for the next fiscal year I think that we can all agree that5:40:35over the course of the past few weeks the world has really woken up to this issue of over policing on how so many of5:40:40society's most pressing problems which have the potential to be addressed and rectified are instead being policed5:40:48Crews already account for the Lion's Share of our budget so rather than just approve another request for more funding5:40:53why not use this particular moment in time this active Global wake-up moment to stop and reflect on how that 4605:41:00Grand might be better spent other communities that have taken the approach of investing more heavily in Social Services and scaling back on police have5:41:07ultimately decreased crime saved taxpayer dollars and elevated human potential given the police have already5:41:13received more than two and a half million dollars in additional budget since 2019 right now just seems like the5:41:18ideal moment to pause on approving yet another increase and instead step back and address how we can better invest in5:41:24our community making Santa Cruz an even better place to live for all thank you [Music]5:41:30here [Music]5:41:36looks like we got5:41:4113 people who have their hands that want to speak and sell we'll just give people a minute each for these last 13 and then5:41:48we're going to move on to our evening item5:41:53okay next week you're online hello this is Elizabeth Clifton Doolin5:41:59I'm a Santa Cruz City resident a long time Community member of 40 years I support5:42:07the Santa Cruz City Police Department under the direction of Andy Mills I5:42:12think it is that they need to continue funding and they've done a beautiful job in5:42:19de-escalating their staff and keeping us all protected thank you Santa5:42:26Cruz Police Department yes5:42:39all right next speaker hi my name is Jennifer teschler and I've lived in the west side of Phoenix for5:42:45seven years I also want a special Santa Cruz and like many people I was upset to learn that 28 of the operating5:42:52budget goes to the police in our city and that they're asking for even more money especially given them pending5:42:57deficit brought by covid I'd like to urge the council to vote against the proposed budget increases the center of office and sepd5:43:03instead we allocate current funding towards services that support our community such as housing education and Parks and Rec other cities are adopting5:43:10this model as they are confronted with this disproportionate violence inflicted by the police on blast indigenous people5:43:15of color and we should not be the last to follow I am a white woman who's allowed to feel safe in Santa Cruz but many of my bike peers do not to the5:43:22point that several have fled the cities I will be tracking how the council members vote on this issue and from how5:43:27I spend my votes in the next election I'd also like to add perhaps council person schoolers refrain to making5:43:33cosmographic remarks like I don't know how to talk about this I'm not a stoner and it's sitting here educate themselves or not speak about things they don't5:43:39know how to talk about thank you for your time5:43:49all right next speaker hi can you hear me yep good evening5:43:57good evening um my name is Cassandra Powell um and I just wanted to address the5:44:03Santa Cruz Police Department's social media as a social media manager by trade5:44:10five days ago there was a post called A Tale of Two protests in which5:44:17the Santa Cruz Police Department on their Facebook Twitter Instagram and on5:44:22the city website said that the violent protest5:44:28um was led by UCSC grad students but that is not at all true5:44:33um and is a blatant Act of defamation and um really trying to divide uh our5:44:42community and is a clearly unfounded and blatant attack on our own citizens5:44:48um so I'm just calling for the police to do better and to like find their sources and uh really5:44:56use their power on social media for the good of the community especially um because that Viral photo of the chief5:45:03officer and you may are coming um has increased their follower count by a lot5:45:10thank you very much yeah5:45:20okay next speaker can you hear me5:45:25good evening good evening my name Linda I'm your resident of Santa Cruz County and I just5:45:31wanted to say that I support creating a special session to discuss the police5:45:37department funding and reallocation of funds to more Community supportive associations and taking some of the5:45:44responsibilities that are placed on police and creating alternative departments to address the issues that5:45:51could be raised without um forced and I also would like to say that5:45:57I support the initiatives to do a mural or the black lives matter movement on5:46:03Front Street thank you5:46:13all right next speaker hello my name is Elizabeth I'm a5:46:18resident of Santa Cruz I want to first take a moment for all the lives that have been lost recently5:46:24um from police brutality from the protest or from covid um and then I just want to5:46:30support all the calls that have been made to refund and reallocate the5:46:35resources that are going towards the police um I think that Santa Cruz deserves to5:46:42be a safe and fair place for everybody not just those white wealthy residents5:46:47and in making the meeting to make these5:46:53budgetary changes that is concretely showing the residents of color that the5:46:58Santa Cruz City Council carers and is committed to eradicating the racism that does exist5:47:05here and that affects the lives of everybody especially those residents of5:47:11color thank you5:47:21hello hello I'm on hi thanks for taking my call my name is5:47:27Mel I'm a Santa Cruz resident and I want to address the proposed increase to the police budget it doesn't make any sense5:47:33to me as well as many other community community members who have stated in this meeting why we would increase the5:47:39police department budget to a proposed 28 of our budget which would be more than multiple sectors combined the5:47:46police which historically started as slave Patrol in the south is entrenched in systematic racism I know you all know5:47:53what that means I know you know what that means black and brown people are racially profiled in Santa Cruz all the5:47:58time we also demand that you immediately stop sending the Santa Cruz Police Department to participate in egregious5:48:05violence against against protesters in Oakland this is this is just wrong and I know y'all know that and you have the power5:48:11to do something the answer is to defund the police and work towards abolishing the police so that we can truly invest5:48:18in community-based Solutions we demand that you call a meeting to address reducing funding for the police5:48:25be on the side of Justice on the police do not doubt that we are all watching to see how you show up or fail to show up5:48:31for justice thank you5:48:39all right next speaker on the line Santa Cruz is a Paradise Beach City5:48:45kissed by the Pacific Ocean Breeze and hugged by the Redwood Forest5:48:51the city also has a long history of racism that spawns from the oppression of the native peoples to the Daily5:48:57harassment or worse of its current non-whites listen to the voices of your people5:49:04they have overwhelmingly spoken you fill the city with more police action you fill the city with the image of a town5:49:10out of control and who wants to vacation or go to college or buy their house in a heavily policed municipality people5:49:19like Justin Bieber vacation in the area because of the giant Dipper not the giant Police Department you have artists5:49:26Educators innovators and passionate population to whom you can direct funding to come up with the solutions5:49:32needed to make Santa Cruz the amazing place it's always meant to be5:49:39the choice is yours you may not have long to make it because the people will speak out and act out against you5:49:46this is black [Music]5:49:54speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening5:50:00hello my name is Nicholas church I was born and raised in Santa Cruz County I'm calling for a defunding and of the5:50:08police department taking up 28 of budget more than Library Public Works and5:50:13economic development and ludicrous I'm truly appalled that we would Center Police Department to Oakland to enforce5:50:20systemic racism we claim to be one of the most liberal places in California let alone the country we need to act5:50:25like it become a Cornerstone for redefining how a community could be protected5:50:31the if you do not act if you do not work5:50:36towards the allocating resources we will see it you are under a microscope now5:50:44act on it I yield my time5:50:53foreign hi my name is Avatar Joshi and I'd like5:50:59to thank the council members for taking my call I've lived in Santa Cruz for the past five years and I've been a5:51:04homeowner for the past two years and I'm calling about the use of excessive force by the police department Across the5:51:10Nation and I know that in city of Santa Cruz that a significant portion of the city's operating budget goes to the5:51:16police department the sepd uses more Force for arrest than 23 percent of other police departments in California5:51:21and the excessive use of force has even been used against peaceful protesters peaceful student protesters on the5:51:28campus of UC Santa Cruz during the cola movement and this is absolutely unacceptable I would like to urge the5:51:35council to vote against the proposed budget increases to the Sheriff's Office and the svpd and instead reallocates5:51:42their current funding towards services that support our community such as housing and Health Department education5:51:48Parks and Rec and Public Works other cities are adopting this model as they're confronting the disproportion of5:51:54violence reflected by the police on black indigenous and people of color and5:51:59we should not be the last to follow I'll be following how the council members vote and I intend to use this issue to5:52:07inform how I vote in the next elections thank you very much for taking my call5:52:12yep all right next speaker5:52:19hello I am also calling to encourage you to put defunding the police on your next5:52:25agenda or to call a special meeting um I agree with everyone that the way we're treating homeless people in this5:52:31county is atrocious and we really should be using money that's currently going to5:52:39mostly harass homeless people it feels like to support them and to address the5:52:45housing affordability crisis thanks y'all5:52:58Phoenix speaker hi my name is Ashley I've lived in Santa Cruz for 23 years as the world grapples5:53:05with tough and necessary decisions about systemic racism policing5:53:12and funding communities I believe it's far past time Santa Cruz does something in all part of this stop sending our5:53:17police to terrorize other communities why is Santa Cruz allowing their cops to go and trample other communities5:53:25right to the free of speech we must end these Mutual Aid agreements sccd's5:53:30budget budgets going to be more than the economic development Community Development and Public Works combined5:53:36with housing crisis climate change at our front door and a pandemic in our hands we must think progressively and5:53:42spending money money for forward change I hope that the council takes us to heart and will push for official time5:53:48for a community to express in depth their concerns and their hopes for a future of this city and take a closer5:53:55look at the proposed increase sbcd's budget and see that if the money would be spent better elsewhere thank you5:54:02give5:54:09all right next speaker hi my name is Veronica Varner5:54:14I'm frankly appalled by the proposal to a lot 28.1 percent of the budget towards policing these budget increases are5:54:20clearly not investing back into our community the one million dollar budget to alleviate homelessness one of the most pressing issues in Santa Cruz5:54:27especially during the time of covid-19 pales in comparison as was only eight an5:54:32eight hundred thousand dollar budget for project room key in Santa Cruz there are 1 204 individuals experiencing5:54:38homelessness with a whopping 78 unsheltered in Santa Cruz with only 150 grams allotted by project green case5:54:45with the city spending 17 million of City resources towards quote reacting to the impact of homelessness it is clear5:54:52that more policing is not going to fix the issue we must reallocate funds towards affordable housing shelters5:54:57Rehabilitation programs related to drugs or mental illness the city is currently burning through money an abusive cycle5:55:04of arrest and release with its population experiencing homelessness and the criminalization of this population5:55:09break the chain reallocate this money and invest in bettering our community defend the police5:55:23all right next speaker hi my name is

sociological and criminal criminal logical5:59:48research on the causes of crime has shown that at least in part crime5:59:57occurs in um because pockets of6:00:02concentrated disadvantage deny people opportunities to participate6:00:08in community in their Greater Community and uh6:00:15invest there for investing in community works and programs that6:00:21center community Advocates from within

the fact that I turned in a petition::to the mayor uh Wednesday of this week I thought it would be in time to be on the::agenda uh the essence of the petition is that it's time for the public to be back::in front of the council uh could be done at the Civic Auditorium I turned in uh:: wet signatures I thought it was important to do this in person in person and not by internet I have four former::mayors signatory and one former council member signatory uh We the People::request and demand that the city council meet in front of the public and not by Electronics::thank you sir thank you::all right next speaker you're online hi this is Scott Graham I was calling about::the zoo meeting that the mayor and the chief of police had::at the during that meeting when questions were taken from the public::police answered everyone's questions except mine and I sent him an email CeCe::the mayor and other council members about this the questions were::demilitarizing the police racial profiling was being done about it::use of force guidelines who can fire a bad cop can the city manager fire a bad::cop or is it only just this chief of police or can the city council go into::special session and fire a bad cop um more non-lethal options like in Japan::they have these net guns that they can shoot a net over somebody that'll trip them up and uh::mobile demobilize them um what are we going to do about the endless harassment of the poorest::members of our society and then uh we need to bring back a::police review board and a police review board that has some teeth not a cute toothless one like the one that was::around before now the other issue is the zoom meetings these Zoom meetings are terrible::half of the uh what is being said is unintelligible::Cynthia Matthews has the worst connection of anybody I can barely::understand anything she says on here and I don't you know it's probably not her::fault to some fault of whatever device she's using or her internet connection I::don't know but we've gotta like Lee broke out just so we got to bring this back:: some years ago there was the beach south of oral herrings held in::the Civic Center live on TV so again

Street please Cooper and hotel and I was absolutely request the::promotion being made for meetings in college to prove that permits necessary if not this one um Sports scenario projects be approved::as soon as possible I know that because it's difficult so that's pretty much but this::sort of gathering necessarily it's more of a protest it supports of black lives::matter by artists and the approval and supportive of government and I think it shows where the Santa Cruz Community::stands um it's for instance those as well as really a call to action for racial::Equity practices the implemented in places in our community where they're not perfect::great thank you::online hi there my name is Jace Richie uh thank::you for taking my call um over the last hour and a half about::um I've gotten to hear a lot of the priorities of what this uh community and::the city council value and it's been frustrating to know that the public::commentary which was set to begin an hour and a half ago is pushed to now but I am grateful for the opportunity to::hear that like myself in a number of my friends and colleagues::the city council members care deeply about the people of::the vet they can consider that When developing in more detail as a budget to::commit to defunding the police department of Santa Cruz a police department that is known::for and has a history of violence against black and brown people and a::city that needs to reinvest public infrastructure in things like affordable housing::all right thank you::Phoenix call you one minute hi my name is Chrissy Hansen mayor::Cummings and City Council Members most of you know me my husband is a Santa::Cruz police officer and I'm calling to implore you to please do not defund or reallocate any money that is allocated::for the police department it is of utmost importance for officer safety and::Community safety as you all know we just lost Sergeant butzweiler my husband was::there during that incident and it brings it home that these officers men and women::all over our County put their hearts and souls into their jobs we all know there::are bad apples in every single job out there but the men and women of the Santa::Cruz Police Department put their hearts and souls into their jobs and they try to do the best they possibly can for our::community it really truly boils down to officer safety and Community safety and I::implore you to look into doing research in other states and states and countries::who have defunded or reallocated money and see what the consequences have been we already have this catch and released::and our did a lot of hats please do not defend::the police department thank you so much for your time thank you::all right next speaker okay this is Garrett Phillip the writers::the arsonists the looters and the anarchists and all of those who want to hijack George Floyd's family's::legitimate demand for justice to further their own personal agendas of division chaos and violence should be condemned::and stopped he sure was a victim of a deadly civil rights righteous officer of that city::government notice I say deadly civil rights abuse and not systemic racism the::outrage should be the same regardless of race and concentrated on government civil rights abuses::and restoring accountability for all government actions needs Focus instead of the inflammatory leftist knee jerk::claim of systematic racism which would raise more than accusations and statistics the Lloyd response reminds me::of the last credible protest of abuse at the hands of the powerful namely Occupy Wall Street where their message of::criminal banking fraud got delegitimatized forgotten and then crushed by the delusion of the hordes::have left a special agenda grievance bongers inappropriately trying to hijack that Financial abuse issue for their own::agendas the result was no reform in the now dare I say we are seeing the BLM the::anarchists the looters the Vandals terrorists antifa the national dirty code tactician press and political::parties taking Focus away from the central issue of an unaccountable government abuse of power for their own::purposes kind of risking another failure or probably worse they might succeed in::destroying Society thanks bye thank you::all right next speaker you're on the line hi my name is Edith I'm a Santa Cruz resident I want to First acknowledge::that we are on the unseated territory of mamamutu I acknowledge the voices in the community that are asking for abolishment of the police in solidarity::with the black lives matter movement according to the city budget proposal scpd is asking for over   more the::next fiscal year which is grand total increased over  million since . as the city must cut costs due to covid-::we must focus our budget on care and resources not surveillance and state violence according to police::scorecard.org fcpd uses more Force batons tasers and strangleholds per arrests and  percent of police::departments in California that is both a physical and mental cost of violence and to error terror on our community as well::as the monetary cost of those weapons if we really want to save money and the work of our community stop sending local::police to other communities such as Oak lift if we want to build a better Santa Cruz postcoded disarm scpd instead of::funding their pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms tasers tear gas and riot gear to use on protesters to have::been peaceful so far direct that money to our house as community members our families and our students who needed a::lot more than white homeowners need a sense of safety provided by the legacy of the slave Patrol thank you so much for your time::thank you::all right next person on the line thanks for taking my call um I want to give prophecy to you mayor::Cummings and to Chief Mills for the way you guys handle the protests::um really super commendable and also my condolences to the uh::Sheriff's Office and the loss of the deputy goodspiler I actually had::tried to comment um item number  and for some reason my star nine didn't hit::so just real briefly there's an issue there I know it was already passed on second meeting but::um that's the uh mandatory involuntary election contribution limits and it's::unclear whether that applies in recall candidate elections as we just had::because there this year with this last recall and I don't want to relive the past it's over::but um the I think that you should make it clear whether they intent of that is to apply::to recall candidates as well because there was a violation if it was::thank you very much thank you::all right next speaker you're online::all right uh the next speaker I am Vice chair of the Santa Cruz Arts::Commission uh first thank you for your time I would like to bring to your attention uh an::application for a permit uh presented by Abby Mustafa for a special event held on::Front Street that is a mural for black lives matter::um I believe this requires immediate attention from the council and once::again thank you for everything::hello hello yeah I'm Ron my name is Peter::Binky I live in Santa Cruz I've been a resident here since . I want to begin by saying that we are in the::unseated territory of up Indians represented by the ominous and tribal bands that black lives matter and::although I will never understand the black experience of racism I stand with black people and people of color::I would like to spend my experience and thought on the conduct and priorities::I've worked as a security guard in Santa Cruz since  beginning at the Crow's Nest and the Blue Lagoon until  and::from  the president at Brady's Yacht Club in the time I have had to handle stabbings drive-by shootings assaults::and talkative people and survive with minimal harm to myself and no harm to others on April th  I was attacked and::assaulted for being gay a stranger assaulted me out of nowhere inside the AC referring to me as a I am a gay::man after leaving the house see my assailant with some other attack myself and a friend::I had to call this cpv three times over two days to get someone to take a statement I was told they were very busy::and put them to be immediately that this was not a priority I understand that there are more important issues in the::hate crime but I feel that it should be a priority after a month I finally had a follow-up::there was video evidence of the assault that that was it other than a letter saying you're the victim of a crime I'm::going to stop you thank you for providing us with that information and let us know if we can follow up with you::on uh suggesting that sounds like a pretty serious concern thank you for calling in::hey all right Mr Speaker hi there I just wanted I just wanted to reach out as a born and::raised resident of Santa Cruz to just address the allocation of our tax dollars and policing in our community::um with kova  City staffers have been recommending that we like cut upwards to six million dollars in spending and I::think it's about the time that the city looks at how much spending is going into the police department and how much we're actually::getting out of it as a community I to reevaluate the city's Financial relationship with policing in ways that::like like there's uh in ways like making officers um liable for misconduct settlements and::not taxpayers from withholding pensions and we're not hires who are involved with excessive::boards and abuse uh claims as well as spending paid leave for costs who are under investigation but I think it's::really really important that we just stop sending our police to terrorize other communities I don't know why Santa::Cruz is allowing their cops to go and trample on another community's right to pre-spread free speech like that system::like wrong side of History stuff I really think we need to end Aid agreement::um you know our city doesn't mirror large urban areas but um find themselves assaulted with militarized police forces::Santa Cruz has in many ways already been a leading example of what a community-led resource could be but I::think it's far from good enough and I hope that the council takes this to heart and will push for official time::for the community to express and that's their concerns thank you::all right next speaker yeah hi my name's Al and I really::appreciate everything you guys do I know it's a hard job first of all I wanted to say that the events that happened over::the weekend with the murder of the deputy sheriff Damon gotzwell has really shaken us all up here::um and it it happens  days after one::of my best friends tusharate was also kidnapped and murdered from his home in pleasure points and::um both with senseless acts of violence um and uh I I've I've been here in Santa::Cruz for a few years and it's been a shock to us that the level of violence here is so high and we believe Annie::Mills and his chief and and and mayor Justin Cummins thank you so much for your courageous and calming impact on::during the BLM um riding downtown it showed a level of::sort of discipline and and Leadership that I hadn't seen before and of course I was in the the marches as well as the::paddle outs for BLM I support everything that they do but I really urge you do not tap the police in fact if you feel::like you need to increase it I'm a big supporter of that thank you for everything that you do and we hope we::can get back to a community with respect love and and all the values that we really appreciate::thank you all right next speaker you're online::hi um my name is Josh grobinski I live in Santa Cruz I want to say I'm really saddened by the violence against the::police this weekend um and I think that there's a way to create a community where the polarization became the police and::the people um is really different the recent events in Minneapolis and covert crisis create::an opportunity to think differently and I think a serious look at how we can rethink the kinds of Power police have and use::we don't need a person with a gun to respond to the vast majority of mental health situations we don't need a person with a gun to deal with a forged  Bill::we don't need a person with a gun to give a speeding ticket we don't need a person with a gun to support homeless people and the list goes on we need::people trained to deal with difficult and most situations not trained to catch criminals which means that we don't need::the police in many many many situations we need to defund the police and there's a whole bunch of things we can do I mean::look at what's happening in Minneapolis so let's be fun to Santa Cruz Police and while we're figuring out how to make that work continuing the hiring free::zone please right now for police out of Oakland and just notice that if we're spending  million dollars with  million dollar Budget on the cops that::is way way too much [Music] foreign::hi my name is Caitlin Hannah I've been a resident of Santa Cruz for  years::in response to the black lives matter movement and Countrywide calls for defunding the police I expect the::council to create a special session or an agenda item at the very least on the next meeting with regards to the::defunding of the scpd and the underfunding of humanitarian and Social Services::over the year I've witnessed countless hours and dollars spent through the scpd on asking our unhoused population to::move to move to move to not sit here to not lay down here I feel that that the::scpd's labor efforts and funds are grossly misused and in need of major reallocation thank you::all right next caller year online::hello can you hear me yes how are you my name is Andrew Carlson I'm a local uh::maker fabricator prototyper and business consultant and I have a budget a bunch::of budgetary questions I hope I have the right data here um but my understanding is that you're::asking to cut six million dollars out of the budget and ironically you're asking to increase the police budget to .::percent which would be larger than the library Public Works Economic Development combined::um and also there's been an insufficient response to Cova especially in terms of PPE my maker lab has actually been::producing a ton of that and it's not been going well it's about the communities are funded so::so I'd like to ask why are we not suspending paid admin for cops who are::under investigation for excessive violence for example and why do we have:: higher excessive force when it comes to::per arrest so  higher rate per arrest violence compared to any other PD and::hopefully anyway I would like to if you find the place thank you [Music]::thank you very much all right next person you're online::hi my name is my name is Elena Ramer I want to demand::the city of Santa Cruz immediately begin a process of defunding the police and begin supporting the needs of our::communities in ways that will eventually make police obsolete that means housing::for all health care for all including mental health care and addiction treatment and other services for all who are in::need it means emergency responders who are not cops and who are trained in Conflict mediation::who are mental health care providers and social workers the city needs to support and fund marginalized communities in::Santa Cruz they deserve care not cops doing so will be a baby step towards::repairing the damage that has been done by over policing police brutality police complicity with ice gentrification and::the general whitewashing of Santa Cruz history and culture we can't settle for reforms that have been tried and have::failed in other cities fight for the future we want and deserve while you're at it and cash bail and end Juvenile::Detention now foreign::Kessler and I'm a resident of Santa Cruz County thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak I'm asking for the::council to not approve an increase in budget for the police force and to instead allocate more funds to education::housing and community-based programs in Santa Cruz I was shocked to learn that::policium took  percent of the city's budget in  while only . percent::went to housing I feel strongly that the police force does not need more funding especially since Santa Cruz Police::Department uses more Force per arrest than  percent of other police departments in California::also be following how each council member votes to determine who I would like to elect in the future as well::thank you for your time::hey next speaker hello my name is Jesse Malley I'm ::year resident here in Santa Cruz California our state and animalism territory I'm calling for the::reallocation of police funds to man carry and social services and we should not be sending costs to do::jobs that should be done by social workers thank you very much thank you::next speaker::hi um my name is Sabina and I live in Santa Cruz I was born here and I raised my::kids here I'm a boring middle-aged white mom that is asking you to defund the police::the police are dangerous they're dangerous to our kids and to our community they treat every situation as::a hammer because that's the tools that they have why are we giving money to a violent forest and the money could go into the::community for good the police budget is . percent of the budget look around::at how many other areas of our community that could use those funds we could house everyone instead our tax dollars::in Santa Cruz are going to sbpd backing up police brutality in Oakland we also need to remove the police from our::schools why are we sending police with guns into our schools I don't want my tax dollars going to that view black::lives matter::all right next speaker good evening I'm a resident of Santa Cruz County and a white resident that::completely supports the black lives matter movement and defunding the police in order to put back the power in the::hands of the community and put an end to the police brutality experience not only in California but all across the United::States leasing our community takes up the largest chunk of our City's General operating budget which means more::funding is going toward policing than Economic Development Library funding and Community Development combined::thanks to the police score.org and your online SC City budget proposal I want to list out some important numbers::again a budget deficit of  to  million due to covid- and the sheriff's office is asking for an ::million dollar increase in the next fiscal year which is completely unacceptable::before my time is up I'd like to summarize some things that I think we should make a priority in the next meeting deep on the police and allocate::the money and resources to Oregon Nations that are specialized in various professions such as social workers and medical suspend use of paid admin leave::for cops under investigation withhold pension from and don't rehire cops involved in excessive force require cops::to be liable for misconduct settlements not taxpayers withdrawn participation of lease militarization programs and::Military exercises disarm the sctd no more pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms armored vehicles tasers tear::gas or riot gear we are people and you are not at war with us thank you for listening::yep::all right next speaker good evening everyone my name is Rachel Martinez and I'm a Santa Cruz resident I::would first like to agree with Caitlin Hannah's request that the council hold a special session for defunding the scpd I::find it extremely concerning that there's over four hundred thousand dollars proposed for the scpd in the upcoming budget it's embarrassing to be::living in a city that boasts progressiveness while sending combat ready officers to a historically black community disciple the voices of their::residents I'm ashamed to live in a city that values a violent and oppressive Police Department over the health and::safety of their citizens defund our Police Department invest in our community and let Santa Cruz be the::progressive Haven you all pretend it is thank you thank you::hi can you hear me yes hey my name is Rachel Chavez I'm at RN::who's lived in Santa Cruz most my life and I've asked I'm here today to ask you to deep on the police services like::housing education and Healthcare have been drained of funds that were siphoned off to an increasingly militarized police force Santa Cruz you only have to::walk around downtown for a minute or so to see the devastating effects of lack of housing in our community in ::funding for housing took up only . percent of the budget Community programs two percent while policing took up ::percent policing is inherently resistant system in Santa Cruz in  black::people made up . percent of all arrests and only . percent of the total population but Andy Mills will::tell you that scpd is too enlightened to act in a racist manner this shows either total misunderstanding or an absolute::refusal to acknowledge how systemic racism is for a petulated in systems but can look to Minneapolis to see that::police reform is implicit bias trading an equivalent unequivocally do not do enough police still wind up murdering::black people with impunity [Music] thank you thank you::hey I'm Milan hi my name is Madison I'm a long-time resident of Santa Cruz::just wanted to offer my thoughts to our council members as we set priorities for our budget in the upcoming weeks I would::like to see the city of Santa Cruz adopt a socially responsible budget that prioritizes Health and Welfare spending::over policing nearly a third of our city General funds are dedicated to policing::and my understanding that the police have requested a budget increase for the - fiscal year this request should be::rejected employees funding should be reallocated toward a Health and Welfare programs reallocating resources would::protect the most vulnerable in our community as the city reckons with the consequences of decreasing resources to::meet the essential needs of its residents and I would just like to say if you fail to prioritize people over police in your::budget considerations not only will I not vote for you when the time comes but I will do everything in my power to help::replace you with more Progressive Challengers thank you for your time yep::hello hello::oh hi um so I'm a downtime resident my name is McKenna::um and I'm calling to ask that you based on the police because um they're funded too heavily and they're::trying to pass ordinances like the quality of life ordinance that actually asks uh that is he criminalized to have::syringes on you without a prescription and other things like camping from  A.M to  pm and then  pm to  A.M which::doesn't make any sense um and yeah I just think the attacking of::homeless people in this community has gone on for far too long I think it's a waste of our time Santa Cruz PD PR uh::does more misdemeanor arrests than  of police departments of California according to policegorecard.com and yeah::I would just say just defund the police um we don't need them to have weapons that they have or the power that they::have thanks::all right next speaker you're on the line hello I'm a Santa Cruz County resident::student at Cabrillo College um I want everyone listening to question::yourself whether you think the Santa Cruz County Police Department is an institution worthy of your taxes instead::of giving them more money to arm themselves as weapons to use against us and also the protesters of Oakland which::we demand fees immediately we should be using that money to create a more robust system of care and support for homeless::people and addicts and to create a team of Crisis responders that resolve conflict without violence I understand::that our mayor is working closely with the police to practice reform however you cannot reform A system that is::inherently violent the criminal justice system is inextricably bound to oppression we cannot solve homelessness::or addiction by criminalizing it our community needs care not cops Minneapolis is already talking about::defunding and understanding their peace I truly believe Santa Cruz would be the perfect place to adopt this model and::become an example for the rest of California we deserve the chance to dream of something better and we can be::better Santa Cruz is amazing and I have faith in us thank you very much::yep::all right next speaker hello thank you for having me my name is Carolina Mejia I'm a long time resident::here I'm also a student at Cabrillo College um I agree with the idea of a special::meeting to talk about black black lives matter and the whole movement but I also agree that with the um budget there::should be so much more money poured into minority um education as a first generation high::school graduate I attend Rio College I'm a daughter of a single mother I'm a minority and a woman I was denied a long::time ago in the public school system as an elementary school student the right to have a proper education I actually::had to leave the system to be able to achieve the same goals that I'm achieving today so I really would want::you guys to consider putting investing so much more money into the education for minority students so that we can::together grow as a community and grow in equal education because it's a human::right um is that pension choose between food on their table and educating their::children thank you yep::okay next speaker uh hi my name's Adam I live in the city::of Santa Cruz uh and I'm calling to ask you to agendize uh reducing the funding::for or even eliminating the Santa Cruz City Police Department::um we can give the important work that the police does to other City departments we can maybe not give anyone::the task of running around the city hassling the homeless we could maybe spend the extra money we saved not doing::that on housing homeless uh and I just don't feel comfortable::having the city employing people who are authorized to kill in my name thank you::all right next speaker::not sure if they just dropped off the line::I was in person McKenna Manas::sorry I also called in my phone and then you I got to talk there so thank you okay thanks::all right next speaker::yeah you're on the line oh hello my name is Keith I'm a long time resident here in Santa Cruz um I::would like to call a meeting about uh the red distribution of the uh of the::budget in Santa Cruz um I feel that uh having the police::department taking up as much of the budget as libraries Public Works and economic development::um combined I think that that needs to be uh looked closer at um there's a::there's a memory that a lot of the students here Santa Cruz have um during the cola::demonstrations with police showing up um and breaking a young man's hand and::smacking a young woman on the skull with a baton so viral photos of police kneeling with::us feels more like a stunt and we want to be involved in um their process thank::you thank you::okay next caller you're on the line hello can you hear me yeah hi I just wanted to call to say::absolutely ridiculous that the Santa Cruz Police Department is receiving  million dollars per year::um which is  of the total budget I really think that we should be investing::in issues such as homelessness housing and for sure climate change um and I know that the budget for::climate change projects which would be investing in our future which is super important to me as a young person to::protect our future generations and the City of Santa Cruz um they get like thirty thousand dollars::a year from the general fund and I think that is an insane contrast compared to  million dollars for the police::department so please please please defund them or at least bring it down a substantial amount thank you thank you::hey next speaker thank you::please turn down your device sorry about that um I just want to say my name is Devin rainwater I'm a resident and::student in Santa Cruz and I want to say to be a police officer is a personal and willful choice and it is a job that can::be easily left um officer safety is not discussing the black lives matter movement because it::is not at risk people who are at risk are by puck folks targeted by years of::systemic racism officers are trained for a very small amount of time to be violent and all cops participate in a::fundamentally racist system we must defund the scpd and instead fund public education housing support and mental::health services that will reduce crime in the city::I hope to see my community safe and this means I want to see an abolition of the police::thank you::Annex speaker hello my name is Anna adanski::Georgetown County Mental Health for the last few years mostly the homeless population and substance abusers so::being inside of that system I think that something that's been happening with the police recently::I think that it makes a lot of sense for Santa Cruz County to funnel some of their funds instead to::preventative care and mental health care::uh housing and food Justice I think that we could take away some of the funding::that's going towards tasers batons and outdated things that are police probably don't::need um I'd like to see strangleholds not be used by famous police and overall I'd::just like to see the finances be funded and reinvested into the care of our communities rather than the policing of::our communities oh yeah Mental Health Training for our::police my brother's a police officer so I know these you know hardcore anti-police but I think I::the escalation anti-racial anti-racist training for mental health training::thank you::hey I'm the one hi my name is Remy and I'm here to::discuss a majority of the calls that the police receive are::um about the homeless population which they are not trained to properly deal with funds need to be reallocated to::mental health and Addiction Services education and housing the funding needs::to be reallocated to support our most vulnerable communities thank you::thank you::all right I would like to bring to the campus::attention the urgency of proposal to create a mural on Front Street to show where we stand on black lives::matter and I would also like to support everyone else in defunding the Santa Cruz Police Department and relocating::funds to education climate change and housing::thank you::hi can you hear me yes good evening hi I'm Lane Edwards I'm a resident of::Santa Cruz County I actually moved here a couple years ago from New Orleans and one thing that I was extremely struck by::similarly to many of my fellow community members is that our police are extremely overfunded from New Orleans a city that::has a much more violent crime they actually have a lower percentage of their cities General funds that go to::the police  of crime in Santa Cruz according to the city website is::non-violent property crime I think we all know why this crime has to happen people are not given the housing they::are not giving the resources and the care they need to live I believe that our City's funds would be much better::and much more humanely used to house the homeless and to provide Youth Care over funding the police I strongly suggest::like my community members that we hold a specific budget meaning about defunding::the police and call that we do progressively slash um beginning with ::defund the police and with the goal of understanding the police thank you so much [Music]::again if you wanted to speak during oral Communications you must press on your phone in order to raise your::hand and I think the next person should be on one::hi is that mean yep hi so I have a few concerns first off last month's a  year old black man::named tamario Smith was found alone dead in his jail cell and the cause of death has still not been released::when someone dies in The care of a public safety department the cause of death needs to be public information to hold those departments accountable::um second my friend's  year old son was recently riding his bike home from Pleasure Point in his wetsuit with a::boogie board when he was pulled over by Santa Cruz sheriff's officer who tried to get him in trouble for being at the::beach during the closure as I hope you know the water has remained open for surfing and Boogie boarding during this::closure and my friend's son was not breaking any rules in the middle of the stop the scso officer had to actually::Google the law that he was trying to enforce and as you know scso is enforcing the beach closures in South::County beaches and this racial profiling is an embarrassing reflection of the carelessness that police in Santa Cruz::exhibit on way too many of their law enforcement contacts so please define consider defunding scpd thank you::all right next speaker::hello this is Ryan MSC oh that was just me I::just spoke apparently thank you yeah::okay next speaker I think this is Melanie Jones::okay I'm gonna move on to the next speaker I think::hi um I'm a resident and homeowner here um and I wanted to address the request::by the scpd for an additional  thousand dollars for the next fiscal year I think that we can all agree that::over the course of the past few weeks the world has really woken up to this issue of over policing on how so many of::society's most pressing problems which have the potential to be addressed and rectified are instead being policed::Crews already account for the Lion's Share of our budget so rather than just approve another request for more funding::why not use this particular moment in time this active Global wake-up moment to stop and reflect on how that ::Grand might be better spent other communities that have taken the approach of investing more heavily in Social Services and scaling back on police have::ultimately decreased crime saved taxpayer dollars and elevated human potential given the police have already::received more than two and a half million dollars in additional budget since  right now just seems like the::ideal moment to pause on approving yet another increase and instead step back and address how we can better invest in::our community making Santa Cruz an even better place to live for all thank you [Music]::here [Music]::looks like we got:: people who have their hands that want to speak and sell we'll just give people a minute each for these last  and then::we're going to move on to our evening item::okay next week you're online hello this is Elizabeth Clifton Doolin::I'm a Santa Cruz City resident a long time Community member of  years I support::the Santa Cruz City Police Department under the direction of Andy Mills I::think it is that they need to continue funding and they've done a beautiful job in::de-escalating their staff and keeping us all protected thank you Santa::Cruz Police Department yes::all right next speaker hi my name is Jennifer teschler and I've lived in the west side of Phoenix for::seven years I also want a special Santa Cruz and like many people I was upset to learn that  of the operating::budget goes to the police in our city and that they're asking for even more money especially given them pending::deficit brought by covid I'd like to urge the council to vote against the proposed budget increases the center of office and sepd::instead we allocate current funding towards services that support our community such as housing education and Parks and Rec other cities are adopting::this model as they are confronted with this disproportionate violence inflicted by the police on blast indigenous people::of color and we should not be the last to follow I am a white woman who's allowed to feel safe in Santa Cruz but many of my bike peers do not to the::point that several have fled the cities I will be tracking how the council members vote on this issue and from how::I spend my votes in the next election I'd also like to add perhaps council person schoolers refrain to making::cosmographic remarks like I don't know how to talk about this I'm not a stoner and it's sitting here educate themselves or not speak about things they don't::know how to talk about thank you for your time::all right next speaker hi can you hear me yep good evening::good evening um my name is Cassandra Powell um and I just wanted to address the::Santa Cruz Police Department's social media as a social media manager by trade::five days ago there was a post called A Tale of Two protests in which::the Santa Cruz Police Department on their Facebook Twitter Instagram and on::the city website said that the violent protest::um was led by UCSC grad students but that is not at all true::um and is a blatant Act of defamation and um really trying to divide uh our::community and is a clearly unfounded and blatant attack on our own citizens::um so I'm just calling for the police to do better and to like find their sources and uh really::use their power on social media for the good of the community especially um because that Viral photo of the chief::officer and you may are coming um has increased their follower count by a lot::thank you very much yeah::okay next speaker can you hear me::good evening good evening my name Linda I'm your resident of Santa Cruz County and I just::wanted to say that I support creating a special session to discuss the police::department funding and reallocation of funds to more Community supportive associations and taking some of the::responsibilities that are placed on police and creating alternative departments to address the issues that::could be raised without um forced and I also would like to say that::I support the initiatives to do a mural or the black lives matter movement on::Front Street thank you::all right next speaker hello my name is Elizabeth I'm a::resident of Santa Cruz I want to first take a moment for all the lives that have been lost recently::um from police brutality from the protest or from covid um and then I just want to::support all the calls that have been made to refund and reallocate the::resources that are going towards the police um I think that Santa Cruz deserves to::be a safe and fair place for everybody not just those white wealthy residents::and in making the meeting to make these::budgetary changes that is concretely showing the residents of color that the::Santa Cruz City Council carers and is committed to eradicating the racism that does exist::here and that affects the lives of everybody especially those residents of::color thank you::hello hello I'm on hi thanks for taking my call my name is::Mel I'm a Santa Cruz resident and I want to address the proposed increase to the police budget it doesn't make any sense::to me as well as many other community community members who have stated in this meeting why we would increase the::police department budget to a proposed  of our budget which would be more than multiple sectors combined the::police which historically started as slave Patrol in the south is entrenched in systematic racism I know you all know::what that means I know you know what that means black and brown people are racially profiled in Santa Cruz all the::time we also demand that you immediately stop sending the Santa Cruz Police Department to participate in egregious::violence against against protesters in Oakland this is this is just wrong and I know y'all know that and you have the power::to do something the answer is to defund the police and work towards abolishing the police so that we can truly invest::in community-based Solutions we demand that you call a meeting to address reducing funding for the police::be on the side of Justice on the police do not doubt that we are all watching to see how you show up or fail to show up::for justice thank you::all right next speaker on the line Santa Cruz is a Paradise Beach City::kissed by the Pacific Ocean Breeze and hugged by the Redwood Forest::the city also has a long history of racism that spawns from the oppression of the native peoples to the Daily::harassment or worse of its current non-whites listen to the voices of your people::they have overwhelmingly spoken you fill the city with more police action you fill the city with the image of a town::out of control and who wants to vacation or go to college or buy their house in a heavily policed municipality people::like Justin Bieber vacation in the area because of the giant Dipper not the giant Police Department you have artists::Educators innovators and passionate population to whom you can direct funding to come up with the solutions::needed to make Santa Cruz the amazing place it's always meant to be::the choice is yours you may not have long to make it because the people will speak out and act out against you::this is black [Music]::speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening::hello my name is Nicholas church I was born and raised in Santa Cruz County I'm calling for a defunding and of the::police department taking up  of budget more than Library Public Works and::economic development and ludicrous I'm truly appalled that we would Center Police Department to Oakland to enforce::systemic racism we claim to be one of the most liberal places in California let alone the country we need to act::like it become a Cornerstone for redefining how a community could be protected::the if you do not act if you do not work::towards the allocating resources we will see it you are under a microscope now::act on it I yield my time::foreign hi my name is Avatar Joshi and I'd like::to thank the council members for taking my call I've lived in Santa Cruz for the past five years and I've been a::homeowner for the past two years and I'm calling about the use of excessive force by the police department Across the::Nation and I know that in city of Santa Cruz that a significant portion of the city's operating budget goes to the::police department the sepd uses more Force for arrest than  percent of other police departments in California::and the excessive use of force has even been used against peaceful protesters peaceful student protesters on the::campus of UC Santa Cruz during the cola movement and this is absolutely unacceptable I would like to urge the::council to vote against the proposed budget increases to the Sheriff's Office and the svpd and instead reallocates::their current funding towards services that support our community such as housing and Health Department education::Parks and Rec and Public Works other cities are adopting this model as they're confronting the disproportion of::violence reflected by the police on black indigenous and people of color and::we should not be the last to follow I'll be following how the council members vote and I intend to use this issue to::inform how I vote in the next elections thank you very much for taking my call::yep all right next speaker::hello I am also calling to encourage you to put defunding the police on your next::agenda or to call a special meeting um I agree with everyone that the way we're treating homeless people in this::county is atrocious and we really should be using money that's currently going to::mostly harass homeless people it feels like to support them and to address the::housing affordability crisis thanks y'all::Phoenix speaker hi my name is Ashley I've lived in Santa Cruz for  years as the world grapples::with tough and necessary decisions about systemic racism policing::and funding communities I believe it's far past time Santa Cruz does something in all part of this stop sending our::police to terrorize other communities why is Santa Cruz allowing their cops to go and trample other communities::right to the free of speech we must end these Mutual Aid agreements sccd's::budget budgets going to be more than the economic development Community Development and Public Works combined::with housing crisis climate change at our front door and a pandemic in our hands we must think progressively and::spending money money for forward change I hope that the council takes us to heart and will push for official time::for a community to express in depth their concerns and their hopes for a future of this city and take a closer::look at the proposed increase sbcd's budget and see that if the money would be spent better elsewhere thank you::give::all right next speaker hi my name is Veronica Varner::I'm frankly appalled by the proposal to a lot . percent of the budget towards policing these budget increases are::clearly not investing back into our community the one million dollar budget to alleviate homelessness one of the most pressing issues in Santa Cruz::especially during the time of covid- pales in comparison as was only eight an::eight hundred thousand dollar budget for project room key in Santa Cruz there are   individuals experiencing::homelessness with a whopping  unsheltered in Santa Cruz with only  grams allotted by project green case::with the city spending  million of City resources towards quote reacting to the impact of homelessness it is clear::that more policing is not going to fix the issue we must reallocate funds towards affordable housing shelters::Rehabilitation programs related to drugs or mental illness the city is currently burning through money an abusive cycle::of arrest and release with its population experiencing homelessness and the criminalization of this population::break the chain reallocate this money and invest in bettering our community defend the police::all right next speaker hi my name is Emory wedel I live in Santa Cruz California and I'm also::calling to defund the

right next speaker uh yes Charles Lee wood I'm a resident of Santa Cruz I think uh the what the::police department is doing is absolutely wonderful I think it should be fully funded I I see::from what

thank you::all right next speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening::um hi this is paper developer and I basically just wanted to Echo what so many others have said and really urge::you guys to

difficulty all right all right next speaker::hello can you hear me yes good evening good evening thank you for taking my call my name is Rachel I am a Santa Cruz::resident born and raised here and I would like to Echo the calls to uh::he fund the police and invest in uh Community programs I would also like::to add that a variety of sociological and criminal criminal logical::research on the causes of crime has shown that at least in part crime::occurs in um because pockets of::concentrated disadvantage deny people opportunities to participate::in community in their Greater Community and uh::invest there for investing in community works and programs that::center community Advocates from within these neighborhoods is a way to::lower crime rates therefore::the need for highly militarized police forces which in fact incite violence as::we have seen across the country this week thank you for taking my call::evening can you hear me yes my name is Santiago as a longtime resident of Santa Cruz I'm calling for::an immediate community meeting or at least for you to add to your agenda the discussion of our current and projected::budgets with the intention specifically of

the defending on the Santa Cruz Police Department and::the reallocation of those funds to community-based programs that are in high demand such as housing mental health education harm reduction::Addiction Services and many more policing these issues has been proven to be ineffective and only hurts our::community further I would also ask that we step away from the practice of mutual Aid which uses taxpayer dollars to enact::violence in cities like Oakland against citizens who are using their right to peacefully protest I would like to also::remind each of you that the members of

the fact that i turned in a petition::to the mayor uh wednesday of this week i thought it would be in time to be on the::agenda uh the essence of the petition is that it's time for the public to be back::in front of the council uh could be done at the civic auditorium i turned in uh:: wet signatures i thought it was important to do this in person in person and not by internet i have four former::mayors signatory and one former council member signatory uh we the people::request and demand that the city council meet in front of the public and not by electronics::thank you sir thank you::all right next speaker you're online hi this is scott graham i was calling about::the zoo meeting that the mayor and the chief of police had::at the during that meeting when questions were taken from the public::police answered everyone's questions except mine and i sent him an email cece::the mayor and other council members about this the questions were::demilitarizing the police racial profiling was being done about it::use of force guidelines who can fire a bad cop can the city manager fire a bad::cop or is it only just this chief of police or can the city council go into::special session and fire a bad cop um more non-lethal options like in japan::they have these net guns that they can shoot a net over somebody that'll trip them up and uh::mobile demobilize them um what are we going to do about the endless harassment of the poorest::members of our society and then uh we need to bring back a::police review board and a police review board that has some teeth not a cute toothless one like the one that was::around before now the other issue is the zoom meetings these zoom meetings are terrible::half of the uh what is being said is unintelligible::cynthia matthews has the worst connection of anybody i can barely::understand anything she says on here and i don't you know it's probably not her::fault to some fault of whatever device she's using or her internet connection i::don't know but we've gotta like lee broke out just so we got to bring this back:: some years ago there was the beach south of oral herrings held in::the civic center live on tv so again there's no reason we can't do that now::thank you thank you::just want to bring to the attention of the city clerk we can't hear the uh the alarm for the end of one minute so just::to let you know okay i cut the mic up to it but i think you were muted so::yeah my name's hi my name is abby mustafa and it's a paperwork for a special events permit::for a mural this is black lives matter on front street please cooper and hotel and i was absolutely request the::promotion being made for meetings in college to prove that permits necessary if not this one um sports scenario projects be approved::as soon as possible i know that because it's difficult so that's pretty much but this::sort of gathering necessarily it's more of a protest it supports of black lives::matter by artists and the approval and supportive of government and i think it shows where the santa cruz community::stands um it's for instance those as well as really a call to action for racial::equity practices the implemented in places in our community where they're not perfect::great thank you::online hi there my name is jace richie uh thank::you for taking my call um over the last hour and a half about::um i've gotten to hear a lot of the priorities of what this uh community and::the city council value and it's been frustrating to know that the public::commentary which was set to begin an hour and a half ago is pushed to now but i am grateful for the opportunity to::hear that like myself in a number of my friends and colleagues::the city council members care deeply about the people of::the vet they can consider that when developing in more detail as a budget to::commit to defunding the police department of santa cruz a police department that is known::for and has a history of violence against black and brown people and a::city that needs to reinvest public infrastructure in things like affordable housing::all right thank you::phoenix call you one minute hi my name is chrissy hansen mayor::cummings and city council members most of you know me my husband is a santa::cruz police officer and i'm calling to implore you to please do not defund or reallocate any money that is allocated::for the police department it is of utmost importance for officer safety and::community safety as you all know we just lost sergeant butzweiler my husband was::there during that incident and it brings it home that these officers men and women::all over our county put their hearts and souls into their jobs we all know there::are bad apples in every single job out there but the men and women of the santa::cruz police department put their hearts and souls into their jobs and they try to do the best they possibly can for our::community it really truly boils down to officer safety and community safety and i::implore you to look into doing research in other states and states and countries::who have defunded or reallocated money and see what the consequences have been we already have this catch and released::and our did a lot of hats please do not defend::the police department thank you so much for your time thank you::all right next speaker okay this is garrett phillip the writers::the arsonists the looters and the anarchists and all of those who want to hijack george floyd's family's::legitimate demand for justice to further their own personal agendas of division chaos and violence should be condemned::and stopped he sure was a victim of a deadly civil rights righteous officer of that city::government notice i say deadly civil rights abuse and not systemic racism the::outrage should be the same regardless of race and concentrated on government civil rights abuses::and restoring accountability for all government actions needs focus instead of the inflammatory leftist knee jerk::claim of systematic racism which would raise more than accusations and statistics the lloyd response reminds me::of the last credible protest of abuse at the hands of the powerful namely occupy wall street where their message of::criminal banking fraud got delegitimatized forgotten and then crushed by the delusion of the hordes::have left a special agenda grievance bongers inappropriately trying to hijack that financial abuse issue for their own::agendas the result was no reform in the now dare i say we are seeing the blm the::anarchists the looters the vandals terrorists antifa the national dirty code tactician press and political::parties taking focus away from the central issue of an unaccountable government abuse of power for their own::purposes kind of risking another failure or probably worse they might succeed in::destroying society thanks bye thank you::all right next speaker you're on the line hi my name is edith i'm a santa cruz resident i want to first acknowledge::that we are on the unseated territory of mamamutu i acknowledge the voices in the community that are asking for abolishment of the police in solidarity::with the black lives matter movement according to the city budget proposal scpd is asking for over   more the::next fiscal year which is grand total increased over  million since . as the city must cut costs due to covid-::we must focus our budget on care and resources not surveillance and state violence according to police::scorecard.org fcpd uses more force batons tasers and strangleholds per arrests and  percent of police::departments in california that is both a physical and mental cost of violence and to error terror on our community as well::as the monetary cost of those weapons if we really want to save money and the work of our community stop sending local::police to other communities such as oak lift if we want to build a better santa cruz postcoded disarm scpd instead of::funding their pepper spray rubber bullets firearms tasers tear gas and riot gear to use on protesters to have::been peaceful so far direct that money to our house as community members our families and our students who needed a::lot more than white homeowners need a sense of safety provided by the legacy of the slave patrol thank you so much for your time::thank you::all right next person on the line thanks for taking my call um i want to give prophecy to you mayor::cummings and to chief mills for the way you guys handle the protests::um really super commendable and also my condolences to the uh::sheriff's office and the loss of the deputy goodspiler i actually had::tried to comment um item number  and for some reason my star nine didn't hit::so just real briefly there's an issue there i know it was already passed on second meeting but::um that's the uh mandatory involuntary election contribution limits and it's::unclear whether that applies in recall candidate elections as we just had::because there this year with this last recall and i don't want to relive the past it's over::but um the i think that you should make it clear whether they intent of that is to apply::to recall candidates as well because there was a violation if it was::thank you very much thank you::all right next speaker you're online::all right uh the next speaker i am vice chair of the santa cruz arts::commission uh first thank you for your time i would like to bring to your attention uh an::application for a permit uh presented by abby mustafa for a special event held on::front street that is a mural for black lives matter::um i believe this requires immediate attention from the council and once::again thank you for everything::hello hello yeah i'm ron my name is peter::binky i live in santa cruz i've been a resident here since . i want to begin by saying that we are in the::unseated territory of up indians represented by the ominous and tribal bands that black lives matter and::although i will never understand the black experience of racism i stand with black people and people of color::i would like to spend my experience and thought on the conduct and priorities::i've worked as a security guard in santa cruz since  beginning at the crow's nest and the blue lagoon until  and::from  the president at brady's yacht club in the time i have had to handle stabbings drive-by shootings assaults::and talkative people and survive with minimal harm to myself and no harm to others on april th  i was attacked and::assaulted for being gay a stranger assaulted me out of nowhere inside the ac referring to me as a i am a gay::man after leaving the house see my assailant with some other attack myself and a friend::i had to call this cpv three times over two days to get someone to take a statement i was told they were very busy::and put them to be immediately that this was not a priority i understand that there are more important issues in the::hate crime but i feel that it should be a priority after a month i finally had a follow-up::there was video evidence of the assault that that was it other than a letter saying you're the victim of a crime i'm::going to stop you thank you for providing us with that information and let us know if we can follow up with you::on uh suggesting that sounds like a pretty serious concern thank you for calling in::hey all right mr speaker hi there i just wanted i just wanted to reach out as a born and::raised resident of santa cruz to just address the allocation of our tax dollars and policing in our community::um with kova  city staffers have been recommending that we like cut upwards to six million dollars in spending and i::think it's about the time that the city looks at how much spending is going into the police department and how much we're actually::getting out of it as a community i to reevaluate the city's financial relationship with policing in ways that::like like there's uh in ways like making officers um liable for misconduct settlements and::not taxpayers from withholding pensions and we're not hires who are involved with excessive::boards and abuse uh claims as well as spending paid leave for costs who are under investigation but i think it's::really really important that we just stop sending our police to terrorize other communities i don't know why santa::cruz is allowing their cops to go and trample on another community's right to pre-spread free speech like that system::like wrong side of history stuff i really think we need to end aid agreement::um you know our city doesn't mirror large urban areas but um find themselves assaulted with militarized police forces::santa cruz has in many ways already been a leading example of what a community-led resource could be but i::think it's far from good enough and i hope that the council takes this to heart and will push for official time::for the community to express and that's their concerns thank you::all right next speaker yeah hi my name's al and i really::appreciate everything you guys do i know it's a hard job first of all i wanted to say that the events that happened over::the weekend with the murder of the deputy sheriff damon gotzwell has really shaken us all up here::um and it it happens  days after one::of my best friends tusharate was also kidnapped and murdered from his home in pleasure points and::um both with senseless acts of violence um and uh i i've i've been here in santa::cruz for a few years and it's been a shock to us that the level of violence here is so high and we believe annie::mills and his chief and and and mayor justin cummins thank you so much for your courageous and calming impact on::during the blm um riding downtown it showed a level of::sort of discipline and and leadership that i hadn't seen before and of course i was in the the marches as well as the::paddle outs for blm i support everything that they do but i really urge you do not tap the police in fact if you feel::like you need to increase it i'm a big supporter of that thank you for everything that you do and we hope we::can get back to a community with respect love and and all the values that we really appreciate::thank you all right next speaker you're online::hi um my name is josh grobinski i live in santa cruz i want to say i'm really saddened by the violence against the::police this weekend um and i think that there's a way to create a community where the polarization became the police and::the people um is really different the recent events in minneapolis and covert crisis create::an opportunity to think differently and i think a serious look at how we can rethink the kinds of power police have and use::we don't need a person with a gun to respond to the vast majority of mental health situations we don't need a person with a gun to deal with a forged  bill::we don't need a person with a gun to give a speeding ticket we don't need a person with a gun to support homeless people and the list goes on we need::people trained to deal with difficult and most situations not trained to catch criminals which means that we don't need::the police in many many many situations we need to defund the police and there's a whole bunch of things we can do i mean::look at what's happening in minneapolis so let's be fun to santa cruz police and while we're figuring out how to make that work continuing the hiring free::zone please right now for police out of oakland and just notice that if we're spending  million dollars with  million dollar budget on the cops that::is way way too much [music] foreign::hi my name is caitlin hannah i've been a resident of santa cruz for  years::in response to the black lives matter movement and countrywide calls for defunding the police i expect the::council to create a special session or an agenda item at the very least on the next meeting with regards to the::defunding of the scpd and the underfunding of humanitarian and social services::over the year i've witnessed countless hours and dollars spent through the scpd on asking our unhoused population to::move to move to move to not sit here to not lay down here i feel that that the::scpd's labor efforts and funds are grossly misused and in need of major reallocation thank you::all right next caller year online::hello can you hear me yes how are you my name is andrew carlson i'm a local uh::maker fabricator prototyper and business consultant and i have a budget a bunch::of budgetary questions i hope i have the right data here um but my understanding is that you're::asking to cut six million dollars out of the budget and ironically you're asking to increase the police budget to .::percent which would be larger than the library public works economic development combined::um and also there's been an insufficient response to cova especially in terms of ppe my maker lab has actually been::producing a ton of that and it's not been going well it's about the communities are funded so::so i'd like to ask why are we not suspending paid admin for cops who are::under investigation for excessive violence for example and why do we have:: higher excessive force when it comes to::per arrest so  higher rate per arrest violence compared to any other pd and::hopefully anyway i would like to if you find the place thank you [music]::thank you very much all right next person you're online::hi my name is my name is elena ramer i want to demand::the city of santa cruz immediately begin a process of defunding the police and begin supporting the needs of our::communities in ways that will eventually make police obsolete that means housing::for all health care for all including mental health care and addiction treatment and other services for all who are in::need it means emergency responders who are not cops and who are trained in conflict mediation::who are mental health care providers and social workers the city needs to support and fund marginalized communities in::santa cruz they deserve care not cops doing so will be a baby step towards::repairing the damage that has been done by over policing police brutality police complicity with ice gentrification and::the general whitewashing of santa cruz history and culture we can't settle for reforms that have been tried and have::failed in other cities fight for the future we want and deserve while you're at it and cash bail and end juvenile::detention now foreign::kessler and i'm a resident of santa cruz county thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak i'm asking for the::council to not approve an increase in budget for the police force and to instead allocate more funds to education::housing and community-based programs in santa cruz i was shocked to learn that::policium took  percent of the city's budget in  while only . percent::went to housing i feel strongly that the police force does not need more funding especially since santa cruz police::department uses more force per arrest than  percent of other police departments in california::also be following how each council member votes to determine who i would like to elect in the future as well::thank you for your time::hey next speaker hello my name is jesse malley i'm ::year resident here in santa cruz california our state and animalism territory i'm calling for the::reallocation of police funds to man carry and social services and we should not be sending costs to do::jobs that should be done by social workers thank you very much thank you::next speaker::hi um my name is sabina and i live in santa cruz i was born here and i raised my::kids here i'm a boring middle-aged white mom that is asking you to defund the police::the police are dangerous they're dangerous to our kids and to our community they treat every situation as::a hammer because that's the tools that they have why are we giving money to a violent forest and the money could go into the::community for good the police budget is . percent of the budget look around::at how many other areas of our community that could use those funds we could house everyone instead our tax dollars::in santa cruz are going to sbpd backing up police brutality in oakland we also need to remove the police from our::schools why are we sending police with guns into our schools i don't want my tax dollars going to that view black::lives matter::all right next speaker good evening i'm a resident of santa cruz county and a white resident that::completely supports the black lives matter movement and defunding the police in order to put back the power in the::hands of the community and put an end to the police brutality experience not only in california but all across the united::states leasing our community takes up the largest chunk of our city's general operating budget which means more::funding is going toward policing than economic development library funding and community development combined::thanks to the police score.org and your online sc city budget proposal i want to list out some important numbers::again a budget deficit of  to  million due to covid- and the sheriff's office is asking for an ::million dollar increase in the next fiscal year which is completely unacceptable::before my time is up i'd like to summarize some things that i think we should make a priority in the next meeting deep on the police and allocate::the money and resources to oregon nations that are specialized in various professions such as social workers and medical suspend use of paid admin leave::for cops under investigation withhold pension from and don't rehire cops involved in excessive force require cops::to be liable for misconduct settlements not taxpayers withdrawn participation of lease militarization programs and::military exercises disarm the sctd no more pepper spray rubber bullets firearms armored vehicles tasers tear::gas or riot gear we are people and you are not at war with us thank you for listening::yep::all right next speaker good evening everyone my name is rachel martinez and i'm a santa cruz resident i::would first like to agree with caitlin hannah's request that the council hold a special session for defunding the scpd i::find it extremely concerning that there's over four hundred thousand dollars proposed for the scpd in the upcoming budget it's embarrassing to be::living in a city that boasts progressiveness while sending combat ready officers to a historically black community disciple the voices of their::residents i'm ashamed to live in a city that values a violent and oppressive police department over the health and::safety of their citizens defund our police department invest in our community and let santa cruz be the::progressive haven you all pretend it is thank you thank you::hi can you hear me yes hey my name is rachel chavez i'm at rn::who's lived in santa cruz most my life and i've asked i'm here today to ask you to deep on the police services like::housing education and healthcare have been drained of funds that were siphoned off to an increasingly militarized police force santa cruz you only have to::walk around downtown for a minute or so to see the devastating effects of lack of housing in our community in ::funding for housing took up only . percent of the budget community programs two percent while policing took up ::percent policing is inherently resistant system in santa cruz in  black::people made up . percent of all arrests and only . percent of the total population but andy mills will::tell you that scpd is too enlightened to act in a racist manner this shows either total misunderstanding or an absolute::refusal to acknowledge how systemic racism is for a petulated in systems but can look to minneapolis to see that::police reform is implicit bias trading an equivalent unequivocally do not do enough police still wind up murdering::black people with impunity [music] thank you thank you::hey i'm milan hi my name is madison i'm a long-time resident of santa cruz::just wanted to offer my thoughts to our council members as we set priorities for our budget in the upcoming weeks i would::like to see the city of santa cruz adopt a socially responsible budget that prioritizes health and welfare spending::over policing nearly a third of our city general funds are dedicated to policing::and my understanding that the police have requested a budget increase for the - fiscal year this request should be::rejected employees funding should be reallocated toward a health and welfare programs reallocating resources would::protect the most vulnerable in our community as the city reckons with the consequences of decreasing resources to::meet the essential needs of its residents and i would just like to say if you fail to prioritize people over police in your::budget considerations not only will i not vote for you when the time comes but i will do everything in my power to help::replace you with more progressive challengers thank you for your time yep::hello hello::oh hi um so i'm a downtime resident my name is mckenna::um and i'm calling to ask that you based on the police because um they're funded too heavily and they're::trying to pass ordinances like the quality of life ordinance that actually asks uh that is he criminalized to have::syringes on you without a prescription and other things like camping from  a.m to  pm and then  pm to  a.m which::doesn't make any sense um and yeah i just think the attacking of::homeless people in this community has gone on for far too long i think it's a waste of our time santa cruz pd pr uh::does more misdemeanor arrests than  of police departments of california according to policegorecard.com and yeah::i would just say just defund the police um we don't need them to have weapons that they have or the power that they::have thanks::all right next speaker you're on the line hello i'm a santa cruz county resident::student at cabrillo college um i want everyone listening to question::yourself whether you think the santa cruz county police department is an institution worthy of your taxes instead::of giving them more money to arm themselves as weapons to use against us and also the protesters of oakland which::we demand fees immediately we should be using that money to create a more robust system of care and support for homeless::people and addicts and to create a team of crisis responders that resolve conflict without violence i understand::that our mayor is working closely with the police to practice reform however you cannot reform a system that is::inherently violent the criminal justice system is inextricably bound to oppression we cannot solve homelessness::or addiction by criminalizing it our community needs care not cops minneapolis is already talking about::defunding and understanding their peace i truly believe santa cruz would be the perfect place to adopt this model and::become an example for the rest of california we deserve the chance to dream of something better and we can be::better santa cruz is amazing and i have faith in us thank you very much::yep::all right next speaker hello thank you for having me my name is carolina mejia i'm a long time resident::here i'm also a student at cabrillo college um i agree with the idea of a special::meeting to talk about black black lives matter and the whole movement but i also agree that with the um budget there::should be so much more money poured into minority um education as a first generation high::school graduate i attend rio college i'm a daughter of a single mother i'm a minority and a woman i was denied a long::time ago in the public school system as an elementary school student the right to have a proper education i actually::had to leave the system to be able to achieve the same goals that i'm achieving today so i really would want::you guys to consider putting investing so much more money into the education for minority students so that we can::together grow as a community and grow in equal education because it's a human::right um is that pension choose between food on their table and educating their::children thank you yep::okay next speaker uh hi my name's adam i live in the city::of santa cruz uh and i'm calling to ask you to agendize uh reducing the funding::for or even eliminating the santa cruz city police department::um we can give the important work that the police does to other city departments we can maybe not give anyone::the task of running around the city hassling the homeless we could maybe spend the extra money we saved not doing::that on housing homeless uh and i just don't feel comfortable::having the city employing people who are authorized to kill in my name thank you::all right next speaker::not sure if they just dropped off the line::i was in person mckenna manas::sorry i also called in my phone and then you i got to talk there so thank you okay thanks::all right next speaker::yeah you're on the line oh hello my name is keith i'm a long time resident here in santa cruz um i::would like to call a meeting about uh the red distribution of the uh of the::budget in santa cruz um i feel that uh having the police::department taking up as much of the budget as libraries public works and economic development::um combined i think that that needs to be uh looked closer at um there's a::there's a memory that a lot of the students here santa cruz have um during the cola::demonstrations with police showing up um and breaking a young man's hand and::smacking a young woman on the skull with a baton so viral photos of police kneeling with::us feels more like a stunt and we want to be involved in um their process thank::you thank you::okay next caller you're on the line hello can you hear me yeah hi i just wanted to call to say::absolutely ridiculous that the santa cruz police department is receiving  million dollars per year::um which is  of the total budget i really think that we should be investing::in issues such as homelessness housing and for sure climate change um and i know that the budget for::climate change projects which would be investing in our future which is super important to me as a young person to::protect our future generations and the city of santa cruz um they get like thirty thousand dollars::a year from the general fund and i think that is an insane contrast compared to  million dollars for the police::department so please please please defund them or at least bring it down a substantial amount thank you thank you::hey next speaker thank you::please turn down your device sorry about that um i just want to say my name is devin rainwater i'm a resident and::student in santa cruz and i want to say to be a police officer is a personal and willful choice and it is a job that can::be easily left um officer safety is not discussing the black lives matter movement because it::is not at risk people who are at risk are by puck folks targeted by years of::systemic racism officers are trained for a very small amount of time to be violent and all cops participate in a::fundamentally racist system we must defund the scpd and instead fund public education housing support and mental::health services that will reduce crime in the city::i hope to see my community safe and this means i want to see an abolition of the police::thank you::annex speaker hello my name is anna adanski::georgetown county mental health for the last few years mostly the homeless population and substance abusers so::being inside of that system i think that something that's been happening with the police recently::i think that it makes a lot of sense for santa cruz county to funnel some of their funds instead to::preventative care and mental health care::uh housing and food justice i think that we could take away some of the funding::that's going towards tasers batons and outdated things that are police probably don't::need um i'd like to see strangleholds not be used by famous police and overall i'd::just like to see the finances be funded and reinvested into the care of our communities rather than the policing of::our communities oh yeah mental health training for our::police my brother's a police officer so i know these you know hardcore anti-police but i think i::the escalation anti-racial anti-racist training for mental health training::thank you::hey i'm the one hi my name is remy and i'm here to::discuss a majority of the calls that the police receive are::um about the homeless population which they are not trained to properly deal with funds need to be reallocated to::mental health and addiction services education and housing the funding needs::to be reallocated to support our most vulnerable communities thank you::thank you::all right i would like to bring to the campus::attention the urgency of proposal to create a mural on front street to show where we stand on black lives::matter and i would also like to support everyone else in defunding the santa cruz police department and relocating::funds to education climate change and housing::thank you::hi can you hear me yes good evening hi i'm lane edwards i'm a resident of::santa cruz county i actually moved here a couple years ago from new orleans and one thing that i was extremely struck by::similarly to many of my fellow community members is that our police are extremely overfunded from new orleans a city that::has a much more violent crime they actually have a lower percentage of their cities general funds that go to::the police  of crime in santa cruz according to the city website is::non-violent property crime i think we all know why this crime has to happen people are not given the housing they::are not giving the resources and the care they need to live i believe that our city's funds would be much better::and much more humanely used to house the homeless and to provide youth care over funding the police i strongly suggest::like my community members that we hold a specific budget meaning about defunding::the police and call that we do progressively slash um beginning with ::defund the police and with the goal of understanding the police thank you so much [music]::again if you wanted to speak during oral communications you must press on your phone in order to raise your::hand and i think the next person should be on one::hi is that mean yep hi so i have a few concerns first off last month's a  year old black man::named tamario smith was found alone dead in his jail cell and the cause of death has still not been released::when someone dies in the care of a public safety department the cause of death needs to be public information to hold those departments accountable::um second my friend's  year old son was recently riding his bike home from pleasure point in his wetsuit with a::boogie board when he was pulled over by santa cruz sheriff's officer who tried to get him in trouble for being at the::beach during the closure as i hope you know the water has remained open for surfing and boogie boarding during this::closure and my friend's son was not breaking any rules in the middle of the stop the scso officer had to actually::google the law that he was trying to enforce and as you know scso is enforcing the beach closures in south::county beaches and this racial profiling is an embarrassing reflection of the carelessness that police in santa cruz::exhibit on way too many of their law enforcement contacts so please define consider defunding scpd thank you::all right next speaker::hello this is ryan msc oh that was just me i::just spoke apparently thank you yeah::okay next speaker i think this is melanie jones::okay i'm gonna move on to the next speaker i think::hi um i'm a resident and homeowner here um and i wanted to address the request::by the scpd for an additional  thousand dollars for the next fiscal year i think that we can all agree that::over the course of the past few weeks the world has really woken up to this issue of over policing on how so many of::society's most pressing problems which have the potential to be addressed and rectified are instead being policed::crews already account for the lion's share of our budget so rather than just approve another request for more funding::why not use this particular moment in time this active global wake-up moment to stop and reflect on how that ::grand might be better spent other communities that have taken the approach of investing more heavily in social services and scaling back on police have::ultimately decreased crime saved taxpayer dollars and elevated human potential given the police have already::received more than two and a half million dollars in additional budget since  right now just seems like the::ideal moment to pause on approving yet another increase and instead step back and address how we can better invest in::our community making santa cruz an even better place to live for all thank you [music]::here [music]::looks like we got:: people who have their hands that want to speak and sell we'll just give people a minute each for these last  and then::we're going to move on to our evening item::okay next week you're online hello this is elizabeth clifton doolin::i'm a santa cruz city resident a long time community member of  years i support::the santa cruz city police department under the direction of andy mills i::think it is that they need to continue funding and they've done a beautiful job in::de-escalating their staff and keeping us all protected thank you santa::cruz police department yes::all right next speaker hi my name is jennifer teschler and i've lived in the west side of phoenix for::seven years i also want a special santa cruz and like many people i was upset to learn that  of the operating::budget goes to the police in our city and that they're asking for even more money especially given them pending::deficit brought by covid i'd like to urge the council to vote against the proposed budget increases the center of office and sepd::instead we allocate current funding towards services that support our community such as housing education and parks and rec other cities are adopting::this model as they are confronted with this disproportionate violence inflicted by the police on blast indigenous people::of color and we should not be the last to follow i am a white woman who's allowed to feel safe in santa cruz but many of my bike peers do not to the::point that several have fled the cities i will be tracking how the council members vote on this issue and from how::i spend my votes in the next election i'd also like to add perhaps council person schoolers refrain to making::cosmographic remarks like i don't know how to talk about this i'm not a stoner and it's sitting here educate themselves or not speak about things they don't::know how to talk about thank you for your time::all right next speaker hi can you hear me yep good evening::good evening um my name is cassandra powell um and i just wanted to address the::santa cruz police department's social media as a social media manager by trade::five days ago there was a post called a tale of two protests in which::the santa cruz police department on their facebook twitter instagram and on::the city website said that the violent protest::um was led by ucsc grad students but that is not at all true::um and is a blatant act of defamation and um really trying to divide uh our::community and is a clearly unfounded and blatant attack on our own citizens::um so i'm just calling for the police to do better and to like find their sources and uh really::use their power on social media for the good of the community especially um because that viral photo of the chief::officer and you may are coming um has increased their follower count by a lot::thank you very much yeah::okay next speaker can you hear me::good evening good evening my name linda i'm your resident of santa cruz county and i just::wanted to say that i support creating a special session to discuss the police::department funding and reallocation of funds to more community supportive associations and taking some of the::responsibilities that are placed on police and creating alternative departments to address the issues that::could be raised without um forced and i also would like to say that::i support the initiatives to do a mural or the black lives matter movement on::front street thank you::all right next speaker hello my name is elizabeth i'm a::resident of santa cruz i want to first take a moment for all the lives that have been lost recently::um from police brutality from the protest or from covid um and then i just want to::support all the calls that have been made to refund and reallocate the::resources that are going towards the police um i think that santa cruz deserves to::be a safe and fair place for everybody not just those white wealthy residents::and in making the meeting to make these::budgetary changes that is concretely showing the residents of color that the::santa cruz city council carers and is committed to eradicating the racism that does exist::here and that affects the lives of everybody especially those residents of::color thank you::hello hello i'm on hi thanks for taking my call my name is::mel i'm a santa cruz resident and i want to address the proposed increase to the police budget it doesn't make any sense::to me as well as many other community community members who have stated in this meeting why we would increase the::police department budget to a proposed  of our budget which would be more than multiple sectors combined the::police which historically started as slave patrol in the south is entrenched in systematic racism i know you all know::what that means i know you know what that means black and brown people are racially profiled in santa cruz all the::time we also demand that you immediately stop sending the santa cruz police department to participate in egregious::violence against against protesters in oakland this is this is just wrong and i know y'all know that and you have the power::to do something the answer is to defund the police and work towards abolishing the police so that we can truly invest::in community-based solutions we demand that you call a meeting to address reducing funding for the police::be on the side of justice on the police do not doubt that we are all watching to see how you show up or fail to show up::for justice thank you::all right next speaker on the line santa cruz is a paradise beach city::kissed by the pacific ocean breeze and hugged by the redwood forest::the city also has a long history of racism that spawns from the oppression of the native peoples to the daily::harassment or worse of its current non-whites listen to the voices of your people::they have overwhelmingly spoken you fill the city with more police action you fill the city with the image of a town::out of control and who wants to vacation or go to college or buy their house in a heavily policed municipality people::like justin bieber vacation in the area because of the giant dipper not the giant police department you have artists::educators innovators and passionate population to whom you can direct funding to come up with the solutions::needed to make santa cruz the amazing place it's always meant to be::the choice is yours you may not have long to make it because the people will speak out and act out against you::this is black [music]::speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening::hello my name is nicholas church i was born and raised in santa cruz county i'm calling for a defunding and of the::police department taking up  of budget more than library public works and::economic development and ludicrous i'm truly appalled that we would center police department to oakland to enforce::systemic racism we claim to be one of the most liberal places in california let alone the country we need to act::like it become a cornerstone for redefining how a community could be protected::the if you do not act if you do not work::towards the allocating resources we will see it you are under a microscope now::act on it i yield my time::foreign hi my name is avatar joshi and i'd like::to thank the council members for taking my call i've lived in santa cruz for the past five years and i've been a::homeowner for the past two years and i'm calling about the use of excessive force by the police department across the::nation and i know that in city of santa cruz that a significant portion of the city's operating budget goes to the::police department the sepd uses more force for arrest than  percent of other police departments in california::and the excessive use of force has even been used against peaceful protesters peaceful student protesters on the::campus of uc santa cruz during the cola movement and this is absolutely unacceptable i would like to urge the::council to vote against the proposed budget increases to the sheriff's office and the svpd and instead reallocates::their current funding towards services that support our community such as housing and health department education::parks and rec and public works other cities are adopting this model as they're confronting the disproportion of::violence reflected by the police on black indigenous and people of color and::we should not be the last to follow i'll be following how the council members vote and i intend to use this issue to::inform how i vote in the next elections thank you very much for taking my call::yep all right next speaker::hello i am also calling to encourage you to put defunding the police on your next::agenda or to call a special meeting um i agree with everyone that the way we're treating homeless people in this::county is atrocious and we really should be using money that's currently going to::mostly harass homeless people it feels like to support them and to address the::housing affordability crisis thanks y'all::phoenix speaker hi my name is ashley i've lived in santa cruz for  years as the world grapples::with tough and necessary decisions about systemic racism policing::and funding communities i believe it's far past time santa cruz does something in all part of this stop sending our::police to terrorize other communities why is santa cruz allowing their cops to go and trample other communities::right to the free of speech we must end these mutual aid agreements sccd's::budget budgets going to be more than the economic development community development and public works combined::with housing crisis climate change at our front door and a pandemic in our hands we must think progressively and::spending money money for forward change i hope that the council takes us to heart and will push for official time::for a community to express in depth their concerns and their hopes for a future of this city and take a closer::look at the proposed increase sbcd's budget and see that if the money would be spent better elsewhere thank you::give::all right next speaker hi my name is veronica varner::i'm frankly appalled by the proposal to a lot . percent of the budget towards policing these budget increases are::clearly not investing back into our community the one million dollar budget to alleviate homelessness one of the most pressing issues in santa cruz::especially during the time of covid- pales in comparison as was only eight an::eight hundred thousand dollar budget for project room key in santa cruz there are   individuals experiencing::homelessness with a whopping  unsheltered in santa cruz with only  grams allotted by project green case::with the city spending  million of city resources towards quote reacting to the impact of homelessness it is clear::that more policing is not going to fix the issue we must reallocate funds towards affordable housing shelters::rehabilitation programs related to drugs or mental illness the city is currently burning through money an abusive cycle::of arrest and release with its population experiencing homelessness and the criminalization of this population::break the chain reallocate this money and invest in bettering our community defend the police::all right next speaker hi my name is emory wedel i live in santa cruz california and i'm also::calling to defund the police you guys have been drilled with all the statistics already we don't need police::in in schools and uh we need to reinvest in our community::services thank you::well you're on one hello::that's

right next speaker uh yes charles lee wood i'm a resident of santa cruz i think uh the what the::police department is doing is absolutely wonderful i think it should be fully funded i i see::from what

thank you::all right next speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening::um hi this is paper developer and i basically just wanted to echo what so many others have said and really urge::you guys to

difficulty all right all right next speaker::hello can you hear me yes good evening good evening thank you for taking my call my name is rachel i am a santa cruz::resident born and raised here and i would like to echo the calls to uh::he fund the police and invest in uh community programs i would also like::to add that a variety of sociological and criminal criminal logical::research on the causes of crime has shown that at least in part crime::occurs in um because pockets of::concentrated disadvantage deny people opportunities to participate::in community in their greater community and uh::invest there for investing in community works and programs that::center community advocates from within these neighborhoods is a way to::lower crime rates therefore::the need for highly militarized police forces which in fact incite violence as::we have seen across the country this week thank you for taking my call::evening can you hear me yes my name is santiago as a longtime resident of santa cruz i'm calling for::an immediate community meeting or at least for you to add to your agenda the discussion of our current and projected::budgets with the intention specifically of

the::voices of many who have spoken before me to call for both the special city council meeting agenda item regarding::the police budget and particularly defending the police i would like to call for the defending on the santa cruz police department and::the reallocation of those funds to community-based programs that are in high demand such as housing mental health education harm reduction::addiction services and many more policing these issues has been proven to be ineffective and only hurts our::community further i would also ask that we step away from the practice of mutual aid which uses taxpayer dollars to enact::violence in cities like oakland against citizens who are using their right to peacefully protest i would like to also::remind each of you that the members of this community will be watching and will hold each of you accountable for the actions you take in the coming weeks and::months thank you yeah okay we have a few speakers what::um then we'll likely

caller before evening item so you're on the line::you're on the mic my name is david doolin i'm a santa cruz resident and::i've ridden with the police a number of times the way that they interact with

same::time act compassionately with with all of the::people that they interact with thank you thank you okay with that::um we are going to take a break and reconvene as::i'll see about     we'll say

call the council's attention to the fact that i turned in a petition::to the mayor uh wednesday of this week i thought it would be in time to be on the::agenda uh the essence of the petition is that it's time for the public to be back::in front of the council uh could be done at the civic auditorium i turned in uh:: wet signatures i thought it was important to do this in person in person and not by internet i have four former::mayors signatory and one former council member signatory uh we the people::request and demand that the city council meet in front of the public and not by electronics::thank you sir thank you::all right next speaker you're online hi this is scott graham i was calling about::the zoo meeting that the mayor and the chief of police had::at the during that meeting when questions were taken from the public::police answered everyone's questions except mine and i sent him an email cece::the mayor and other council members about this the questions were::demilitarizing the police racial profiling was being done about it::use of force guidelines who can fire a bad cop can the city manager fire a bad::cop or is it only just this chief of police or can the city council go into::special session and fire a bad cop um more non-lethal options like in japan::they have these net guns that they can shoot a net over somebody that'll trip them up and uh::mobile demobilize them um what are we going to do about the endless harassment of the poorest::members of our society and then uh we need to bring back a::police review board and a police review board that has some teeth not a cute toothless one like the one that was::around before now the other issue is the zoom meetings these zoom meetings are terrible::half of the uh what is being said is unintelligible::cynthia matthews has the worst connection of anybody i can barely::understand anything she says on here and i don't you know it's probably not her::fault to some fault of whatever device she's using or her internet connection i::don't know but we've gotta like lee broke out just so we got to bring this back:: some years ago there was the beach south of oral herrings held in::the civic center live on tv so again there's no reason we can't do that now::thank you thank you::just want to bring to the attention of the city clerk we can't hear the uh the alarm for the end of one minute so just::to let you know okay i cut the mic up to it but i think you were muted so::yeah my name's hi my name is abby mustafa and it's a paperwork for a special events permit::for a mural this is black lives matter on front street please cooper and hotel and i was absolutely request the::promotion being made for meetings in college to prove that permits necessary if not this one um sports scenario projects be approved::as soon as possible i know that because it's difficult so that's pretty much but this::sort of gathering necessarily it's more of a protest it supports of black lives::matter by artists and the approval and supportive of government and i think it shows where the santa cruz community::stands um it's for instance those as well as really a call to action for racial::equity practices the implemented in places in our community where they're not perfect::great thank you::online hi there my name is jace richie uh thank::you for taking my call um over the last hour and a half about::um i've gotten to hear a lot of the priorities of what this uh community and::the city council value and it's been frustrating to know that the public::commentary which was set to begin an hour and a half ago is pushed to now but i am grateful for the opportunity to::hear that like myself in a number of my friends and colleagues::the city council members care deeply about the people of::the vet they can consider that when developing in more detail as a budget to::commit to defunding the police department of santa cruz a police department that is known::for and has a history of violence against black and brown people and a::city that needs to reinvest public infrastructure in things like affordable housing::all right thank you::phoenix call you one minute hi my name is chrissy hansen mayor::cummings and city council members most of you know me my husband is a santa::cruz police officer and i'm calling to implore you to please do not defund or reallocate any money that is allocated::for the police department it is of utmost importance for officer safety and::community safety as you all know we just lost sergeant butzweiler my husband was::there during that incident and it brings it home that these officers men and women::all over our county put their hearts and souls into their jobs we all know there::are bad apples in every single job out there but the men and women of the santa::cruz police department put their hearts and souls into their jobs and they try to do the best they possibly can for our::community it really truly boils down to officer safety and community safety and i::implore you to look into doing research in other states and states and countries::who have defunded or reallocated money and see what the consequences have been we already have this catch and released::and our did a lot of hats please do not defend::the police department thank you so much for your time thank you::all right next speaker okay this is garrett phillip the writers::the arsonists the looters and the anarchists and all of those who want to hijack george floyd's family's::legitimate demand for justice to further their own personal agendas of division chaos and violence should be condemned::and stopped he sure was a victim of a deadly civil rights righteous officer of that city::government notice i say deadly civil rights abuse and not systemic racism the::outrage should be the same regardless of race and concentrated on government civil rights abuses::and restoring accountability for all government actions needs focus instead of the inflammatory leftist knee jerk::claim of systematic racism which would raise more than accusations and statistics the lloyd response reminds me::of the last credible protest of abuse at the hands of the powerful namely occupy wall street where their message of::criminal banking fraud got delegitimatized forgotten and then crushed by the delusion of the hordes::have left a special agenda grievance bongers inappropriately trying to hijack that financial abuse issue for their own::agendas the result was no reform in the now dare i say we are seeing the blm the::anarchists the looters the vandals terrorists antifa the national dirty code tactician press and political::parties taking focus away from the central issue of an unaccountable government abuse of power for their own::purposes kind of risking another failure or probably worse they might succeed in::destroying society thanks bye thank you::all right next speaker you're on the line hi my name is edith i'm a santa cruz resident i want to first acknowledge::that we are on the unseated territory of mamamutu i acknowledge the voices in the community that are asking for abolishment of the police in solidarity::with the black lives matter movement according to the city budget proposal scpd is asking for over   more the::next fiscal year which is grand total increased over  million since . as the city must cut costs due to covid-::we must focus our budget on care and resources not surveillance and state violence according to police::scorecard.org fcpd uses more force batons tasers and strangleholds per arrests and  percent of police::departments in california that is both a physical and mental cost of violence and to error terror on our community as well::as the monetary cost of those weapons if we really want to save money and the work of our community stop sending local::police to other communities such as oak lift if we want to build a better santa cruz postcoded disarm scpd instead of::funding their pepper spray rubber bullets firearms tasers tear gas and riot gear to use on protesters to have::been peaceful so far direct that money to our house as community members our families and our students who needed a::lot more than white homeowners need a sense of safety provided by the legacy of the slave patrol thank you so much for your time::thank you::all right next person on the line thanks for taking my call um i want to give prophecy to you mayor::cummings and to chief mills for the way you guys handle the protests::um really super commendable and also my condolences to the uh::sheriff's office and the loss of the deputy goodspiler i actually had::tried to comment um item number  and for some reason my star nine didn't hit::so just real briefly there's an issue there i know it was already passed on second meeting but::um that's the uh mandatory involuntary election contribution limits and it's::unclear whether that applies in recall candidate elections as we just had::because there this year with this last recall and i don't want to relive the past it's over::but um the i think that you should make it clear whether they intent of that is to apply::to recall candidates as well because there was a violation if it was::thank you very much thank you::all right next speaker you're online::all right uh the next speaker i am vice chair of the santa cruz arts::commission uh first thank you for your time i would like to bring to your attention uh an::application for a permit uh presented by abby mustafa for a special event held on::front street that is a mural for black lives matter::um i believe this requires immediate attention from the council and once::again thank you for everything::hello hello yeah i'm ron my name is peter::binky i live in santa cruz i've been a resident here since . i want to begin by saying that we are in the::unseated territory of up indians represented by the ominous and tribal bands that black lives matter and::although i will never understand the black experience of racism i stand with black people and people of color::i would like to spend my experience and thought on the conduct and priorities::i've worked as a security guard in santa cruz since  beginning at the crow's nest and the blue lagoon until  and::from  the president at brady's yacht club in the time i have had to handle stabbings drive-by shootings assaults::and talkative people and survive with minimal harm to myself and no harm to others on april th  i was attacked and::assaulted for being gay a stranger assaulted me out of nowhere inside the ac referring to me as a i am a gay::man after leaving the house see my assailant with some other attack myself and a friend::i had to call this cpv three times over two days to get someone to take a statement i was told they were very busy::and put them to be immediately that this was not a priority i understand that there are more important issues in the::hate crime but i feel that it should be a priority after a month i finally had a follow-up::there was video evidence of the assault that that was it other than a letter saying you're the victim of a crime i'm::going to stop you thank you for providing us with that information and let us know if we can follow up with you::on uh suggesting that sounds like a pretty serious concern thank you for calling in::hey all right mr speaker hi there i just wanted i just wanted to reach out as a born and::raised resident of santa cruz to just address the allocation of our tax dollars and policing in our community::um with kova  city staffers have been recommending that we like cut upwards to six million dollars in spending and i::think it's about the time that the city looks at how much spending is going into the police department and how much we're actually::getting out of it as a community i to reevaluate the city's financial relationship with policing in ways that::like like there's uh in ways like making officers um liable for misconduct settlements and::not taxpayers from withholding pensions and we're not hires who are involved with excessive::boards and abuse uh claims as well as spending paid leave for costs who are under investigation but i think it's::really really important that we just stop sending our police to terrorize other communities i don't know why santa::cruz is allowing their cops to go and trample on another community's right to pre-spread free speech like that system::like wrong side of history stuff i really think we need to end aid agreement::um you know our city doesn't mirror large urban areas but um find themselves assaulted with militarized police forces::santa cruz has in many ways already been a leading example of what a community-led resource could be but i::think it's far from good enough and i hope that the council takes this to heart and will push for official time::for the community to express and that's their concerns thank you::all right next speaker yeah hi my name's al and i really::appreciate everything you guys do i know it's a hard job first of all i wanted to say that the events that happened over::the weekend with the murder of the deputy sheriff damon gotzwell has really shaken us all up here::um and it it happens  days after one::of my best friends tusharate was also kidnapped and murdered from his home in pleasure points and::um both with senseless acts of violence um and uh i i've i've been here in santa::cruz for a few years and it's been a shock to us that the level of violence here is so high and we believe annie::mills and his chief and and and mayor justin cummins thank you so much for your courageous and calming impact on::during the blm um riding downtown it showed a level of::sort of discipline and and leadership that i hadn't seen before and of course i was in the the marches as well as the::paddle outs for blm i support everything that they do but i really urge you do not tap the police in fact if you feel::like you need to increase it i'm a big supporter of that thank you for everything that you do and we hope we::can get back to a community with respect love and and all the values that we really appreciate::thank you all right next speaker you're online::hi um my name is josh grobinski i live in santa cruz i want to say i'm really saddened by the violence against the::police this weekend um and i think that there's a way to create a community where the polarization became the police and::the people um is really different the recent events in minneapolis and covert crisis create::an opportunity to think differently and i think a serious look at how we can rethink the kinds of power police have and use::we don't need a person with a gun to respond to the vast majority of mental health situations we don't need a person with a gun to deal with a forged  bill::we don't need a person with a gun to give a speeding ticket we don't need a person with a gun to support homeless people and the list goes on we need::people trained to deal with difficult and most situations not trained to catch criminals which means that we don't need::the police in many many many situations we need to defund the police and there's a whole bunch of things we can do i mean::look at what's happening in minneapolis so let's be fun to santa cruz police and while we're figuring out how to make that work continuing the hiring free::zone please right now for police out of oakland and just notice that if we're spending  million dollars with  million dollar budget on the cops that::is way way too much [music] foreign::hi my name is caitlin hannah i've been a resident of santa cruz for  years::in response to the black lives matter movement and countrywide calls for defunding the police i expect the::council to create a special session or an agenda item at the very least on the next meeting with regards to the::defunding of the scpd and the underfunding of humanitarian and social services::over the year i've witnessed countless hours and dollars spent through the scpd on asking our unhoused population to::move to move to move to not sit here to not lay down here i feel that that the::scpd's labor efforts and funds are grossly misused and in need of major reallocation thank you::all right next caller year online::hello can you hear me yes how are you my name is andrew carlson i'm a local uh::maker fabricator prototyper and business consultant and i have a budget a bunch::of budgetary questions i hope i have the right data here um but my understanding is that you're::asking to cut six million dollars out of the budget and ironically you're asking to increase the police budget to .::percent which would be larger than the library public works economic development combined::um and also there's been an insufficient response to cova especially in terms of ppe my maker lab has actually been::producing a ton of that and it's not been going well it's about the communities are funded so::so i'd like to ask why are we not suspending paid admin for cops who are::under investigation for excessive violence for example and why do we have:: higher excessive force when it comes to::per arrest so  higher rate per arrest violence compared to any other pd and::hopefully anyway i would like to if you find the place thank you [music]::thank you very much all right next person you're online::hi my name is my name is elena ramer i want to demand::the city of santa cruz immediately begin a process of defunding the police and begin supporting the needs of our::communities in ways that will eventually make police obsolete that means housing::for all health care for all including mental health care and addiction treatment and other services for all who are in::need it means emergency responders who are not cops and who are trained in conflict mediation::who are mental health care providers and social workers the city needs to support and fund marginalized communities in::santa cruz they deserve care not cops doing so will be a baby step towards::repairing the damage that has been done by over policing police brutality police complicity with ice gentrification and::the general whitewashing of santa cruz history and culture we can't settle for reforms that have been tried and have::failed in other cities fight for the future we want and deserve while you're at it and cash bail and end juvenile::detention now foreign::kessler and i'm a resident of santa cruz county thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak i'm asking for the::council to not approve an increase in budget for the police force and to instead allocate more funds to education::housing and community-based programs in santa cruz i was shocked to learn that::policium took  percent of the city's budget in  while only . percent::went to housing i feel strongly that the police force does not need more funding especially since santa cruz police::department uses more force per arrest than  percent of other police departments in california::also be following how each council member votes to determine who i would like to elect in the future as well::thank you for your time::hey next speaker hello my name is jesse malley i'm ::year resident here in santa cruz california our state and animalism territory i'm calling for the::reallocation of police funds to man carry and social services and we should not be sending costs to do::jobs that should be done by social workers thank you very much thank you::next speaker::hi um my name is sabina and i live in santa cruz i was born here and i raised my::kids here i'm a boring middle-aged white mom that is asking you to defund the police::the police are dangerous they're dangerous to our kids and to our community they treat every situation as::a hammer because that's the tools that they have why are we giving money to a violent forest and the money could go into the::community for good the police budget is . percent of the budget look around::at how many other areas of our community that could use those funds we could house everyone instead our tax dollars::in santa cruz are going to sbpd backing up police brutality in oakland we also need to remove the police from our::schools why are we sending police with guns into our schools i don't want my tax dollars going to that view black::lives matter::all right next speaker good evening i'm a resident of santa cruz county and a white resident that::completely supports the black lives matter movement and defunding the police in order to put back the power in the::hands of the community and put an end to the police brutality experience not only in california but all across the united::states leasing our community takes up the largest chunk of our city's general operating budget which means more::funding is going toward policing than economic development library funding and community development combined::thanks to the police score.org and your online sc city budget proposal i want to list out some important numbers::again a budget deficit of  to  million due to covid- and the sheriff's office is asking for an ::million dollar increase in the next fiscal year which is completely unacceptable::before my time is up i'd like to summarize some things that i think we should make a priority in the next meeting deep on the police and allocate::the money and resources to oregon nations that are specialized in various professions such as social workers and medical suspend use of paid admin leave::for cops under investigation withhold pension from and don't rehire cops involved in excessive force require cops::to be liable for misconduct settlements not taxpayers withdrawn participation of lease militarization programs and::military exercises disarm the sctd no more pepper spray rubber bullets firearms armored vehicles tasers tear::gas or riot gear we are people and you are not at war with us thank you for listening::yep::all right next speaker good evening everyone my name is rachel martinez and i'm a santa cruz resident i::would first like to agree with caitlin hannah's request that the council hold a special session for defunding the scpd i::find it extremely concerning that there's over four hundred thousand dollars proposed for the scpd in the upcoming budget it's embarrassing to be::living in a city that boasts progressiveness while sending combat ready officers to a historically black community disciple the voices of their::residents i'm ashamed to live in a city that values a violent and oppressive police department over the health and::safety of their citizens defund our police department invest in our community and let santa cruz be the::progressive haven you all pretend it is thank you thank you::hi can you hear me yes hey my name is rachel chavez i'm at rn::who's lived in santa cruz most my life and i've asked i'm here today to ask you to deep on the police services like::housing education and healthcare have been drained of funds that were siphoned off to an increasingly militarized police force santa cruz you only have to::walk around downtown for a minute or so to see the devastating effects of lack of housing in our community in ::funding for housing took up only . percent of the budget community programs two percent while policing took up ::percent policing is inherently resistant system in santa cruz in  black::people made up . percent of all arrests and only . percent of the total population but andy mills will::tell you that scpd is too enlightened to act in a racist manner this shows either total misunderstanding or an absolute::refusal to acknowledge how systemic racism is for a petulated in systems but can look to minneapolis to see that::police reform is implicit bias trading an equivalent unequivocally do not do enough police still wind up murdering::black people with impunity [music] thank you thank you::hey i'm milan hi my name is madison i'm a long-time resident of santa cruz::just wanted to offer my thoughts to our council members as we set priorities for our budget in the upcoming weeks i would::like to see the city of santa cruz adopt a socially responsible budget that prioritizes health and welfare spending::over policing nearly a third of our city general funds are dedicated to policing::and my understanding that the police have requested a budget increase for the - fiscal year this request should be::rejected employees funding should be reallocated toward a health and welfare programs reallocating resources would::protect the most vulnerable in our community as the city reckons with the consequences of decreasing resources to::meet the essential needs of its residents and i would just like to say if you fail to prioritize people over police in your::budget considerations not only will i not vote for you when the time comes but i will do everything in my power to help::replace you with more progressive challengers thank you for your time yep::hello hello::oh hi um so i'm a downtime resident my name is mckenna::um and i'm calling to ask that you based on the police because um they're funded too heavily and they're::trying to pass ordinances like the quality of life ordinance that actually asks uh that is he criminalized to have::syringes on you without a prescription and other things like camping from  a.m to  pm and then  pm to  a.m which::doesn't make any sense um and yeah i just think the attacking of::homeless people in this community has gone on for far too long i think it's a waste of our time santa cruz pd pr uh::does more misdemeanor arrests than  of police departments of california according to policegorecard.com and yeah::i would just say just defund the police um we don't need them to have weapons that they have or the power that they::have thanks::all right next speaker you're on the line hello i'm a santa cruz county resident::student at cabrillo college um i want everyone listening to question::yourself whether you think the santa cruz county police department is an institution worthy of your taxes instead::of giving them more money to arm themselves as weapons to use against us and also the protesters of oakland which::we demand fees immediately we should be using that money to create a more robust system of care and support for homeless::people and addicts and to create a team of crisis responders that resolve conflict without violence i understand::that our mayor is working closely with the police to practice reform however you cannot reform a system that is::inherently violent the criminal justice system is inextricably bound to oppression we cannot solve homelessness::or addiction by criminalizing it our community needs care not cops minneapolis is already talking about::defunding and understanding their peace i truly believe santa cruz would be the perfect place to adopt this model and::become an example for the rest of california we deserve the chance to dream of something better and we can be::better santa cruz is amazing and i have faith in us thank you very much::yep::all right next speaker hello thank you for having me my name is carolina mejia i'm a long time resident::here i'm also a student at cabrillo college um i agree with the idea of a special::meeting to talk about black black lives matter and the whole movement but i also agree that with the um budget there::should be so much more money poured into minority um education as a first generation high::school graduate i attend rio college i'm a daughter of a single mother i'm a minority and a woman i was denied a long::time ago in the public school system as an elementary school student the right to have a proper education i actually::had to leave the system to be able to achieve the same goals that i'm achieving today so i really would want::you guys to consider putting investing so much more money into the education for minority students so that we can::together grow as a community and grow in equal education because it's a human::right um is that pension choose between food on their table and educating their::children thank you yep::okay next speaker uh hi my name's adam i live in the city::of santa cruz uh and i'm calling to ask you to agendize uh reducing the funding::for or even eliminating the santa cruz city police department::um we can give the important work that the police does to other city departments we can maybe not give anyone::the task of running around the city hassling the homeless we could maybe spend the extra money we saved not doing::that on housing homeless uh and i just don't feel comfortable::having the city employing people who are authorized to kill in my name thank you::all right next speaker::not sure if they just dropped off the line::i was in person mckenna manas::sorry i also called in my phone and then you i got to talk there so thank you okay thanks::all right next speaker::yeah you're on the line oh hello my name is keith i'm a long time resident here in santa cruz um i::would like to call a meeting about uh the red distribution of the uh of the::budget in santa cruz um i feel that uh having the police::department taking up as much of the budget as libraries public works and economic development::um combined i think that that needs to be uh looked closer at um there's a::there's a memory that a lot of the students here santa cruz have um during the cola::demonstrations with police showing up um and breaking a young man's hand and::smacking a young woman on the skull with a baton so viral photos of police kneeling with::us feels more like a stunt and we want to be involved in um their process thank::you thank you::okay next caller you're on the line hello can you hear me yeah hi i just wanted to call to say::absolutely ridiculous that the santa cruz police department is receiving  million dollars per year::um which is  of the total budget i really think that we should be investing::in issues such as homelessness housing and for sure climate change um and i know that the budget for::climate change projects which would be investing in our future which is super important to me as a young person to::protect our future generations and the city of santa cruz um they get like thirty thousand dollars::a year from the general fund and i think that is an insane contrast compared to  million dollars for the police::department so please please please defund them or at least bring it down a substantial amount thank you thank you::hey next speaker thank you::please turn down your device sorry about that um i just want to say my name is devin rainwater i'm a resident and::student in santa cruz and i want to say to be a police officer is a personal and willful choice and it is a job that can::be easily left um officer safety is not discussing the black lives matter movement because it::is not at risk people who are at risk are by puck folks targeted by years of::systemic racism officers are trained for a very small amount of time to be violent and all cops participate in a::fundamentally racist system we must defund the scpd and instead fund public education housing support and mental::health services that will reduce crime in the city::i hope to see my community safe and this means i want to see an abolition of the police::thank you::annex speaker hello my name is anna adanski::georgetown county mental health for the last few years mostly the homeless population and substance abusers so::being inside of that system i think that something that's been happening with the police recently::i think that it makes a lot of sense for santa cruz county to funnel some of their funds instead to::preventative care and mental health care::uh housing and food justice i think that we could take away some of the funding::that's going towards tasers batons and outdated things that are police probably don't::need um i'd like to see strangleholds not be used by famous police and overall i'd::just like to see the finances be funded and reinvested into the care of our communities rather than the policing of::our communities oh yeah mental health training for our::police my brother's a police officer so i know these you know hardcore anti-police but i think i::the escalation anti-racial anti-racist training for mental health training::thank you::hey i'm the one hi my name is remy and i'm here to::discuss a majority of the calls that the police receive are::um about the homeless population which they are not trained to properly deal with funds need to be reallocated to::mental health and addiction services education and housing the funding needs::to be reallocated to support our most vulnerable communities thank you::thank you::all right i would like to bring to the campus::attention the urgency of proposal to create a mural on front street to show where we stand on black lives::matter and i would also like to support everyone else in defunding the santa cruz police department and relocating::funds to education climate change and housing::thank you::hi can you hear me yes good evening hi i'm lane edwards i'm a resident of::santa cruz county i actually moved here a couple years ago from new orleans and one thing that i was extremely struck by::similarly to many of my fellow community members is that our police are extremely overfunded from new orleans a city that::has a much more violent crime they actually have a lower percentage of their cities general funds that go to::the police  of crime in santa cruz according to the city website is::non-violent property crime i think we all know why this crime has to happen people are not given the housing they::are not giving the resources and the care they need to live i believe that our city's funds would be much better::and much more humanely used to house the homeless and to provide youth care over funding the police i strongly suggest::like my community members that we hold a specific budget meaning about defunding::the police and call that we do progressively slash um beginning with ::defund the police and with the goal of understanding the police thank you so much [music]::again if you wanted to speak during oral communications you must press on your phone in order to raise your::hand and i think the next person should be on one::hi is that mean yep hi so i have a few concerns first off last month's a  year old black man::named tamario smith was found alone dead in his jail cell and the cause of death has still not been released::when someone dies in the care of a public safety department the cause of death needs to be public information to hold those departments accountable::um second my friend's  year old son was recently riding his bike home from pleasure point in his wetsuit with a::boogie board when he was pulled over by santa cruz sheriff's officer who tried to get him in trouble for being at the::beach during the closure as i hope you know the water has remained open for surfing and boogie boarding during this::closure and my friend's son was not breaking any rules in the middle of the stop the scso officer had to actually::google the law that he was trying to enforce and as you know scso is enforcing the beach closures in south::county beaches and this racial profiling is an embarrassing reflection of the carelessness that police in santa cruz::exhibit on way too many of their law enforcement contacts so please define consider defunding scpd thank you::all right next speaker::hello this is ryan msc oh that was just me i::just spoke apparently thank you yeah::okay next speaker i think this is melanie jones::okay i'm gonna move on to the next speaker i think::hi um i'm a resident and homeowner here um and i wanted to address the request::by the scpd for an additional  thousand dollars for the next fiscal year i think that we can all agree that::over the course of the past few weeks the world has really woken up to this issue of over policing on how so many of::society's most pressing problems which have the potential to be addressed and rectified are instead being policed::crews already account for the lion's share of our budget so rather than just approve another request for more funding::why not use this particular moment in time this active global wake-up moment to stop and reflect on how that ::grand might be better spent other communities that have taken the approach of investing more heavily in social services and scaling back on police have::ultimately decreased crime saved taxpayer dollars and elevated human potential given the police have already::received more than two and a half million dollars in additional budget since  right now just seems like the::ideal moment to pause on approving yet another increase and instead step back and address how we can better invest in::our community making santa cruz an even better place to live for all thank you [music]::here [music]::looks like we got:: people who have their hands that want to speak and sell we'll just give people a minute each for these last  and then::we're going to move on to our evening item::okay next week you're online hello this is elizabeth clifton doolin::i'm a santa cruz city resident a long time community member of  years i support::the santa cruz city police department under the direction of andy mills i::think it is that they need to continue funding and they've done a beautiful job in::de-escalating their staff and keeping us all protected thank you santa::cruz police department yes::all right next speaker hi my name is jennifer teschler and i've lived in the west side of phoenix for::seven years i also want a special santa cruz and like many people i was upset to learn that  of the operating::budget goes to the police in our city and that they're asking for even more money especially given them pending::deficit brought by covid i'd like to urge the council to vote against the proposed budget increases the center of office and sepd::instead we allocate current funding towards services that support our community such as housing education and parks and rec other cities are adopting::this model as they are confronted with this disproportionate violence inflicted by the police on blast indigenous people::of color and we should not be the last to follow i am a white woman who's allowed to feel safe in santa cruz but many of my bike peers do not to the::point that several have fled the cities i will be tracking how the council members vote on this issue and from how::i spend my votes in the next election i'd also like to add perhaps council person schoolers refrain to making::cosmographic remarks like i don't know how to talk about this i'm not a stoner and it's sitting here educate themselves or not speak about things they don't::know how to talk about thank you for your time::all right next speaker hi can you hear me yep good evening::good evening um my name is cassandra powell um and i just wanted to address the::santa cruz police department's social media as a social media manager by trade::five days ago there was a post called a tale of two protests in which::the santa cruz police department on their facebook twitter instagram and on::the city website said that the violent protest::um was led by ucsc grad students but that is not at all true::um and is a blatant act of defamation and um really trying to divide uh our::community and is a clearly unfounded and blatant attack on our own citizens::um so i'm just calling for the police to do better and to like find their sources and uh really::use their power on social media for the good of the community especially um because that viral photo of the chief::officer and you may are coming um has increased their follower count by a lot::thank you very much yeah::okay next speaker can you hear me::good evening good evening my name linda i'm your resident of santa cruz county and i just::wanted to say that i support creating a special session to discuss the police::department funding and reallocation of funds to more community supportive associations and taking some of the::responsibilities that are placed on police and creating alternative departments to address the issues that::could be raised without um forced and i also would like to say that::i support the initiatives to do a mural or the black lives matter movement on::front street thank you::all right next speaker hello my name is elizabeth i'm a::resident of santa cruz i want to first take a moment for all the lives that have been lost recently::um from police brutality from the protest or from covid um and then i just want to::support all the calls that have been made to refund and reallocate the::resources that are going towards the police um i think that santa cruz deserves to::be a safe and fair place for everybody not just those white wealthy residents::and in making the meeting to make these::budgetary changes that is concretely showing the residents of color that the::santa cruz city council carers and is committed to eradicating the racism that does exist::here and that affects the lives of everybody especially those residents of::color thank you::hello hello i'm on hi thanks for taking my call my name is::mel i'm a santa cruz resident and i want to address the proposed increase to the police budget it doesn't make any sense::to me as well as many other community community members who have stated in this meeting why we would increase the::police department budget to a proposed  of our budget which would be more than multiple sectors combined the::police which historically started as slave patrol in the south is entrenched in systematic racism i know you all know::what that means i know you know what that means black and brown people are racially profiled in santa cruz all the::time we also demand that you immediately stop sending the santa cruz police department to participate in egregious::violence against against protesters in oakland this is this is just wrong and i know y'all know that and you have the power::to do something the answer is to defund the police and work towards abolishing the police so that we can truly invest::in community-based solutions we demand that you call a meeting to address reducing funding for the police::be on the side of justice on the police do not doubt that we are all watching to see how you show up or fail to show up::for justice thank you::all right next speaker on the line santa cruz is a paradise beach city::kissed by the pacific ocean breeze and hugged by the redwood forest::the city also has a long history of racism that spawns from the oppression of the native peoples to the daily::harassment or worse of its current non-whites listen to the voices of your people::they have overwhelmingly spoken you fill the city with more police action you fill the city with the image of a town::out of control and who wants to vacation or go to college or buy their house in a heavily policed municipality people::like justin bieber vacation in the area because of the giant dipper not the giant police department you have artists::educators innovators and passionate population to whom you can direct funding to come up with the solutions::needed to make santa cruz the amazing place it's always meant to be::the choice is yours you may not have long to make it because the people will speak out and act out against you::this is black [music]::speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening::hello my name is nicholas church i was born and raised in santa cruz county i'm calling for a defunding and of the::police department taking up  of budget more than library public works and::economic development and ludicrous i'm truly appalled that we would center police department to oakland to enforce::systemic racism we claim to be one of the most liberal places in california let alone the country we need to act::like it become a cornerstone for redefining how a community could be protected::the if you do not act if you do not work::towards the allocating resources we will see it you are under a microscope now::act on it i yield my time::foreign hi my name is avatar joshi and i'd like::to thank the council members for taking my call i've lived in santa cruz for the past five years and i've been a::homeowner for the past two years and i'm calling about the use of excessive force by the police department across the::nation and i know that in city of santa cruz that a significant portion of the city's operating budget goes to the::police department the sepd uses more force for arrest than  percent of other police departments in california::and the excessive use of force has even been used against peaceful protesters peaceful student protesters on the::campus of uc santa cruz during the cola movement and this is absolutely unacceptable i would like to urge the::council to vote against the proposed budget increases to the sheriff's office and the svpd and instead reallocates::their current funding towards services that support our community such as housing and health department education::parks and rec and public works other cities are adopting this model as they're confronting the disproportion of::violence reflected by the police on black indigenous and people of color and::we should not be the last to follow i'll be following how the council members vote and i intend to use this issue to::inform how i vote in the next elections thank you very much for taking my call::yep all right next speaker::hello i am also calling to encourage you to put defunding the police on your next::agenda or to call a special meeting um i agree with everyone that the way we're treating homeless people in this::county is atrocious and we really should be using money that's currently going to::mostly harass homeless people it feels like to support them and to address the::housing affordability crisis thanks y'all::phoenix speaker hi my name is ashley i've lived in santa cruz for  years as the world grapples::with tough and necessary decisions about systemic racism policing::and funding communities i believe it's far past time santa cruz does something in all part of this stop sending our::police to terrorize other communities why is santa cruz allowing their cops to go and trample other communities::right to the free of speech we must end these mutual aid agreements sccd's::budget budgets going to be more than the economic development community development and public works combined::with housing crisis climate change at our front door and a pandemic in our hands we must think progressively and::spending money money for forward change i hope that the council takes us to heart and will push for official time::for a community to express in depth their concerns and their hopes for a future of this city and take a closer::look at the proposed increase sbcd's budget and see that if the money would be spent better elsewhere thank you::give::all right next speaker hi my name is veronica varner::i'm frankly appalled by the proposal to a lot . percent of the budget towards policing these budget increases are::clearly not investing back into our community the one million dollar budget to alleviate homelessness one of the most pressing issues in santa cruz::especially during the time of covid- pales in comparison as was only eight an::eight hundred thousand dollar budget for project room key in santa cruz there are   individuals experiencing::homelessness with a whopping  unsheltered in santa cruz with only  grams allotted by project green case::with the city spending  million of city resources towards quote reacting to the impact of homelessness it is clear::that more policing is not going to fix the issue we must reallocate funds towards affordable housing shelters::rehabilitation programs related to drugs or mental illness the city is currently burning through money an abusive cycle::of arrest and release with its population experiencing homelessness and the criminalization of this population::break the chain reallocate this money and invest in bettering our community defend the police::all right next speaker hi my name is emory wedel i live in santa cruz california and i'm also::calling to defund the police you guys have been drilled with all the statistics already we don't need police::in in schools and uh we need to reinvest in our community::services thank you::well you're on one hello::that's the first note well you're on the line::hello my name is victoria nobles and i have lived in santa cruz county for  years i co-own a preschool and live oak::serving families of children aged two to

would like to echo the calls to uh::he fund the police and invest in uh community programs i would also like::to add that a variety of sociological and criminal criminal logical::research on the causes of crime has shown that at least in part crime::occurs in um because pockets of::concentrated disadvantage deny people opportunities to participate::in community in their greater community and uh::invest there for investing in community works and programs that::center community advocates from within these neighborhoods is a way to::lower crime rates therefore::the need for highly militarized police forces which in fact incite violence as::we have seen across the country this week thank you for taking my call::evening can you hear me yes my name is santiago as a longtime
