the fact that I turned in a petition::to the mayor uh Wednesday of this week I thought it would be in time to be on the::agenda uh the essence of the petition is that it's time for the public to be back::in front of the council uh could be done at the Civic Auditorium I turned in uh:: wet signatures I thought it was important to do this in person in person and not by internet I have four former::mayors signatory and one former council member signatory uh We the People::request and demand that the city council meet in front of the public and not by Electronics::thank you sir thank you::all right next speaker you're online hi this is Scott Graham I was calling about::the zoo meeting that the mayor and the chief of police had::at the during that meeting when questions were taken from the public::police answered everyone's questions except mine and I sent him an email CeCe::the mayor and other council members about this the questions were::demilitarizing the police racial profiling was being done about it::use of force guidelines who can fire a bad cop can the city manager fire a bad::cop or is it only just this chief of police or can the city council go into::special session and fire a bad cop um more non-lethal options like in Japan::they have these net guns that they can shoot a net over somebody that'll trip them up and uh::mobile demobilize them um what are we going to do about the endless harassment of the poorest::members of our society and then uh we need to bring back a::police review board and a police review board that has some teeth not a cute toothless one like the one that was::around before now the other issue is the zoom meetings these Zoom meetings are terrible::half of the uh what is being said is unintelligible::Cynthia Matthews has the worst connection of anybody I can barely::understand anything she says on here and I don't you know it's probably not her::fault to some fault of whatever device she's using or her internet connection I::don't know but we've gotta like Lee broke out just so we got to bring this back:: some years ago there was the beach south of oral herrings held in::the Civic Center live on TV so again there's no reason we can't do that now::thank you thank you::just want to bring to the attention of the city clerk we can't hear the uh the alarm for the end of one minute so just::to let you know okay I cut the mic up to it but I think you were muted so::yeah my name's hi my name is Abby Mustafa and it's a paperwork for a special events permit::for a mural this is black lives matter on Front Street please Cooper and hotel and I was absolutely request the::promotion being made for meetings in college to prove that permits necessary if not this one um Sports scenario projects be approved::as soon as possible I know that because it's difficult so that's pretty much but this::sort of gathering necessarily it's more of a protest it supports of black lives::matter by artists and the approval and supportive of government and I think it shows where the Santa Cruz Community::stands um it's for instance those as well as really a call to action for racial::Equity practices the implemented in places in our community where they're not perfect::great thank you::online hi there my name is Jace Richie uh thank::you for taking my call um over the last hour and a half about::um I've gotten to hear a lot of the priorities of what this uh community and::the city council value and it's been frustrating to know that the public::commentary which was set to begin an hour and a half ago is pushed to now but I am grateful for the opportunity to::hear that like myself in a number of my friends and colleagues::the city council members care deeply about the people of::the vet they can consider that When developing in more detail as a budget to::commit to defunding the police department of Santa Cruz a police department that is known::for and has a history of violence against black and brown people and a::city that needs to reinvest public infrastructure in things like affordable housing::all right thank you::Phoenix call you one minute hi my name is Chrissy Hansen mayor::Cummings and City Council Members most of you know me my husband is a Santa::Cruz police officer and I'm calling to implore you to please do not defund or reallocate any money that is allocated::for the police department it is of utmost importance for officer safety and::Community safety as you all know we just lost Sergeant butzweiler my husband was::there during that incident and it brings it home that these officers men and women::all over our County put their hearts and souls into their jobs we all know there::are bad apples in every single job out there but the men and women of the Santa::Cruz Police Department put their hearts and souls into their jobs and they try to do the best they possibly can for our::community it really truly boils down to officer safety and Community safety and I::implore you to look into doing research in other states and states and countries::who have defunded or reallocated money and see what the consequences have been we already have this catch and released::and our did a lot of hats please do not defend::the police department thank you so much for your time thank you::all right next speaker okay this is Garrett Phillip the writers::the arsonists the looters and the anarchists and all of those who want to hijack George Floyd's family's::legitimate demand for justice to further their own personal agendas of division chaos and violence should be condemned::and stopped he sure was a victim of a deadly civil rights righteous officer of that city::government notice I say deadly civil rights abuse and not systemic racism the::outrage should be the same regardless of race and concentrated on government civil rights abuses::and restoring accountability for all government actions needs Focus instead of the inflammatory leftist knee jerk::claim of systematic racism which would raise more than accusations and statistics the Lloyd response reminds me::of the last credible protest of abuse at the hands of the powerful namely Occupy Wall Street where their message of::criminal banking fraud got delegitimatized forgotten and then crushed by the delusion of the hordes::have left a special agenda grievance bongers inappropriately trying to hijack that Financial abuse issue for their own::agendas the result was no reform in the now dare I say we are seeing the BLM the::anarchists the looters the Vandals terrorists antifa the national dirty code tactician press and political::parties taking Focus away from the central issue of an unaccountable government abuse of power for their own::purposes kind of risking another failure or probably worse they might succeed in::destroying Society thanks bye thank you::all right next speaker you're on the line hi my name is Edith I'm a Santa Cruz resident I want to First acknowledge::that we are on the unseated territory of mamamutu I acknowledge the voices in the community that are asking for abolishment of the police in solidarity::with the black lives matter movement according to the city budget proposal scpd is asking for over   more the::next fiscal year which is grand total increased over  million since . as the city must cut costs due to covid-::we must focus our budget on care and resources not surveillance and state violence according to police::scorecard.org fcpd uses more Force batons tasers and strangleholds per arrests and  percent of police::departments in California that is both a physical and mental cost of violence and to error terror on our community as well::as the monetary cost of those weapons if we really want to save money and the work of our community stop sending local::police to other communities such as Oak lift if we want to build a better Santa Cruz postcoded disarm scpd instead of::funding their pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms tasers tear gas and riot gear to use on protesters to have::been peaceful so far direct that money to our house as community members our families and our students who needed a::lot more than white homeowners need a sense of safety provided by the legacy of the slave Patrol thank you so much for your time::thank you::all right next person on the line thanks for taking my call um I want to give prophecy to you mayor::Cummings and to Chief Mills for the way you guys handle the protests::um really super commendable and also my condolences to the uh::Sheriff's Office and the loss of the deputy goodspiler I actually had::tried to comment um item number  and for some reason my star nine didn't hit::so just real briefly there's an issue there I know it was already passed on second meeting but::um that's the uh mandatory involuntary election contribution limits and it's::unclear whether that applies in recall candidate elections as we just had::because there this year with this last recall and I don't want to relive the past it's over::but um the I think that you should make it clear whether they intent of that is to apply::to recall candidates as well because there was a violation if it was::thank you very much thank you::all right next speaker you're online::all right uh the next speaker I am Vice chair of the Santa Cruz Arts::Commission uh first thank you for your time I would like to bring to your attention uh an::application for a permit uh presented by Abby Mustafa for a special event held on::Front Street that is a mural for black lives matter::um I believe this requires immediate attention from the council and once::again thank you for everything::hello hello yeah I'm Ron my name is Peter::Binky I live in Santa Cruz I've been a resident here since . I want to begin by saying that we are in the::unseated territory of up Indians represented by the ominous and tribal bands that black lives matter and::although I will never understand the black experience of racism I stand with black people and people of color::I would like to spend my experience and thought on the conduct and priorities::I've worked as a security guard in Santa Cruz since  beginning at the Crow's Nest and the Blue Lagoon until  and::from  the president at Brady's Yacht Club in the time I have had to handle stabbings drive-by shootings assaults::and talkative people and survive with minimal harm to myself and no harm to others on April th  I was attacked and::assaulted for being gay a stranger assaulted me out of nowhere inside the AC referring to me as a I am a gay::man after leaving the house see my assailant with some other attack myself and a friend::I had to call this cpv three times over two days to get someone to take a statement I was told they were very busy::and put them to be immediately that this was not a priority I understand that there are more important issues in the::hate crime but I feel that it should be a priority after a month I finally had a follow-up::there was video evidence of the assault that that was it other than a letter saying you're the victim of a crime I'm::going to stop you thank you for providing us with that information and let us know if we can follow up with you::on uh suggesting that sounds like a pretty serious concern thank you for calling in::hey all right Mr Speaker hi there I just wanted I just wanted to reach out as a born and::raised resident of Santa Cruz to just address the allocation of our tax dollars and policing in our community::um with kova  City staffers have been recommending that we like cut upwards to six million dollars in spending and I::think it's about the time that the city looks at how much spending is going into the police department and how much we're actually::getting out of it as a community I to reevaluate the city's Financial relationship with policing in ways that::like like there's uh in ways like making officers um liable for misconduct settlements and::not taxpayers from withholding pensions and we're not hires who are involved with excessive::boards and abuse uh claims as well as spending paid leave for costs who are under investigation but I think it's::really really important that we just stop sending our police to terrorize other communities I don't know why Santa::Cruz is allowing their cops to go and trample on another community's right to pre-spread free speech like that system::like wrong side of History stuff I really think we need to end Aid agreement::um you know our city doesn't mirror large urban areas but um find themselves assaulted with militarized police forces::Santa Cruz has in many ways already been a leading example of what a community-led resource could be but I::think it's far from good enough and I hope that the council takes this to heart and will push for official time::for the community to express and that's their concerns thank you::all right next speaker yeah hi my name's Al and I really::appreciate everything you guys do I know it's a hard job first of all I wanted to say that the events that happened over::the weekend with the murder of the deputy sheriff Damon gotzwell has really shaken us all up here::um and it it happens  days after one::of my best friends tusharate was also kidnapped and murdered from his home in pleasure points and::um both with senseless acts of violence um and uh I I've I've been here in Santa::Cruz for a few years and it's been a shock to us that the level of violence here is so high and we believe Annie::Mills and his chief and and and mayor Justin Cummins thank you so much for your courageous and calming impact on::during the BLM um riding downtown it showed a level of::sort of discipline and and Leadership that I hadn't seen before and of course I was in the the marches as well as the::paddle outs for BLM I support everything that they do but I really urge you do not tap the police in fact if you feel::like you need to increase it I'm a big supporter of that thank you for everything that you do and we hope we::can get back to a community with respect love and and all the values that we really appreciate::thank you all right next speaker you're online::hi um my name is Josh grobinski I live in Santa Cruz I want to say I'm really saddened by the violence against the::police this weekend um and I think that there's a way to create a community where the polarization became the police and::the people um is really different the recent events in Minneapolis and covert crisis create::an opportunity to think differently and I think a serious look at how we can rethink the kinds of Power police have and use::we don't need a person with a gun to respond to the vast majority of mental health situations we don't need a person with a gun to deal with a forged  Bill::we don't need a person with a gun to give a speeding ticket we don't need a person with a gun to support homeless people and the list goes on we need::people trained to deal with difficult and most situations not trained to catch criminals which means that we don't need::the police in many many many situations we need to defund the police and there's a whole bunch of things we can do I mean::look at what's happening in Minneapolis so let's be fun to Santa Cruz Police and while we're figuring out how to make that work continuing the hiring free::zone please right now for police out of Oakland and just notice that if we're spending  million dollars with  million dollar Budget on the cops that::is way way too much [Music] foreign::hi my name is Caitlin Hannah I've been a resident of Santa Cruz for  years::in response to the black lives matter movement and Countrywide calls for defunding the police I expect the::council to create a special session or an agenda item at the very least on the next meeting with regards to the::defunding of the scpd and the underfunding of humanitarian and Social Services::over the year I've witnessed countless hours and dollars spent through the scpd on asking our unhoused population to::move to move to move to not sit here to not lay down here I feel that that the::scpd's labor efforts and funds are grossly misused and in need of major reallocation thank you::all right next caller year online::hello can you hear me yes how are you my name is Andrew Carlson I'm a local uh::maker fabricator prototyper and business consultant and I have a budget a bunch::of budgetary questions I hope I have the right data here um but my understanding is that you're::asking to cut six million dollars out of the budget and ironically you're asking to increase the police budget to .::percent which would be larger than the library Public Works Economic Development combined::um and also there's been an insufficient response to Cova especially in terms of PPE my maker lab has actually been::producing a ton of that and it's not been going well it's about the communities are funded so::so I'd like to ask why are we not suspending paid admin for cops who are::under investigation for excessive violence for example and why do we have:: higher excessive force when it comes to::per arrest so  higher rate per arrest violence compared to any other PD and::hopefully anyway I would like to if you find the place thank you [Music]::thank you very much all right next person you're online::hi my name is my name is Elena Ramer I want to demand::the city of Santa Cruz immediately begin a process of defunding the police and begin supporting the needs of our::communities in ways that will eventually make police obsolete that means housing::for all health care for all including mental health care and addiction treatment and other services for all who are in::need it means emergency responders who are not cops and who are trained in Conflict mediation::who are mental health care providers and social workers the city needs to support and fund marginalized communities in::Santa Cruz they deserve care not cops doing so will be a baby step towards::repairing the damage that has been done by over policing police brutality police complicity with ice gentrification and::the general whitewashing of Santa Cruz history and culture we can't settle for reforms that have been tried and have::failed in other cities fight for the future we want and deserve while you're at it and cash bail and end Juvenile::Detention now foreign::Kessler and I'm a resident of Santa Cruz County thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak I'm asking for the::council to not approve an increase in budget for the police force and to instead allocate more funds to education::housing and community-based programs in Santa Cruz I was shocked to learn that::policium took  percent of the city's budget in  while only . percent::went to housing I feel strongly that the police force does not need more funding especially since Santa Cruz Police::Department uses more Force per arrest than  percent of other police departments in California::also be following how each council member votes to determine who I would like to elect in the future as well::thank you for your time::hey next speaker hello my name is Jesse Malley I'm ::year resident here in Santa Cruz California our state and animalism territory I'm calling for the::reallocation of police funds to man carry and social services and we should not be sending costs to do::jobs that should be done by social workers thank you very much thank you::next speaker::hi um my name is Sabina and I live in Santa Cruz I was born here and I raised my::kids here I'm a boring middle-aged white mom that is asking you to defund the police::the police are dangerous they're dangerous to our kids and to our community they treat every situation as::a hammer because that's the tools that they have why are we giving money to a violent forest and the money could go into the::community for good the police budget is . percent of the budget look around::at how many other areas of our community that could use those funds we could house everyone instead our tax dollars::in Santa Cruz are going to sbpd backing up police brutality in Oakland we also need to remove the police from our::schools why are we sending police with guns into our schools I don't want my tax dollars going to that view black::lives matter::all right next speaker good evening I'm a resident of Santa Cruz County and a white resident that::completely supports the black lives matter movement and defunding the police in order to put back the power in the::hands of the community and put an end to the police brutality experience not only in California but all across the United::States leasing our community takes up the largest chunk of our City's General operating budget which means more::funding is going toward policing than Economic Development Library funding and Community Development combined::thanks to the police score.org and your online SC City budget proposal I want to list out some important numbers::again a budget deficit of  to  million due to covid- and the sheriff's office is asking for an ::million dollar increase in the next fiscal year which is completely unacceptable::before my time is up I'd like to summarize some things that I think we should make a priority in the next meeting deep on the police and allocate::the money and resources to Oregon Nations that are specialized in various professions such as social workers and medical suspend use of paid admin leave::for cops under investigation withhold pension from and don't rehire cops involved in excessive force require cops::to be liable for misconduct settlements not taxpayers withdrawn participation of lease militarization programs and::Military exercises disarm the sctd no more pepper spray rubber bullets Firearms armored vehicles tasers tear::gas or riot gear we are people and you are not at war with us thank you for listening::yep::all right next speaker good evening everyone my name is Rachel Martinez and I'm a Santa Cruz resident I::would first like to agree with Caitlin Hannah's request that the council hold a special session for defunding the scpd I::find it extremely concerning that there's over four hundred thousand dollars proposed for the scpd in the upcoming budget it's embarrassing to be::living in a city that boasts progressiveness while sending combat ready officers to a historically black community disciple the voices of their::residents I'm ashamed to live in a city that values a violent and oppressive Police Department over the health and::safety of their citizens defund our Police Department invest in our community and let Santa Cruz be the::progressive Haven you all pretend it is thank you thank you::hi can you hear me yes hey my name is Rachel Chavez I'm at RN::who's lived in Santa Cruz most my life and I've asked I'm here today to ask you to deep on the police services like::housing education and Healthcare have been drained of funds that were siphoned off to an increasingly militarized police force Santa Cruz you only have to::walk around downtown for a minute or so to see the devastating effects of lack of housing in our community in ::funding for housing took up only . percent of the budget Community programs two percent while policing took up ::percent policing is inherently resistant system in Santa Cruz in  black::people made up . percent of all arrests and only . percent of the total population but Andy Mills will::tell you that scpd is too enlightened to act in a racist manner this shows either total misunderstanding or an absolute::refusal to acknowledge how systemic racism is for a petulated in systems but can look to Minneapolis to see that::police reform is implicit bias trading an equivalent unequivocally do not do enough police still wind up murdering::black people with impunity [Music] thank you thank you::hey I'm Milan hi my name is Madison I'm a long-time resident of Santa Cruz::just wanted to offer my thoughts to our council members as we set priorities for our budget in the upcoming weeks I would::like to see the city of Santa Cruz adopt a socially responsible budget that prioritizes Health and Welfare spending::over policing nearly a third of our city General funds are dedicated to policing::and my understanding that the police have requested a budget increase for the - fiscal year this request should be::rejected employees funding should be reallocated toward a Health and Welfare programs reallocating resources would::protect the most vulnerable in our community as the city reckons with the consequences of decreasing resources to::meet the essential needs of its residents and I would just like to say if you fail to prioritize people over police in your::budget considerations not only will I not vote for you when the time comes but I will do everything in my power to help::replace you with more Progressive Challengers thank you for your time yep::hello hello::oh hi um so I'm a downtime resident my name is McKenna::um and I'm calling to ask that you based on the police because um they're funded too heavily and they're::trying to pass ordinances like the quality of life ordinance that actually asks uh that is he criminalized to have::syringes on you without a prescription and other things like camping from  A.M to  pm and then  pm to  A.M which::doesn't make any sense um and yeah I just think the attacking of::homeless people in this community has gone on for far too long I think it's a waste of our time Santa Cruz PD PR uh::does more misdemeanor arrests than  of police departments of California according to policegorecard.com and yeah::I would just say just defund the police um we don't need them to have weapons that they have or the power that they::have thanks::all right next speaker you're on the line hello I'm a Santa Cruz County resident::student at Cabrillo College um I want everyone listening to question::yourself whether you think the Santa Cruz County Police Department is an institution worthy of your taxes instead::of giving them more money to arm themselves as weapons to use against us and also the protesters of Oakland which::we demand fees immediately we should be using that money to create a more robust system of care and support for homeless::people and addicts and to create a team of Crisis responders that resolve conflict without violence I understand::that our mayor is working closely with the police to practice reform however you cannot reform A system that is::inherently violent the criminal justice system is inextricably bound to oppression we cannot solve homelessness::or addiction by criminalizing it our community needs care not cops Minneapolis is already talking about::defunding and understanding their peace I truly believe Santa Cruz would be the perfect place to adopt this model and::become an example for the rest of California we deserve the chance to dream of something better and we can be::better Santa Cruz is amazing and I have faith in us thank you very much::yep::all right next speaker hello thank you for having me my name is Carolina Mejia I'm a long time resident::here I'm also a student at Cabrillo College um I agree with the idea of a special::meeting to talk about black black lives matter and the whole movement but I also agree that with the um budget there::should be so much more money poured into minority um education as a first generation high::school graduate I attend Rio College I'm a daughter of a single mother I'm a minority and a woman I was denied a long::time ago in the public school system as an elementary school student the right to have a proper education I actually::had to leave the system to be able to achieve the same goals that I'm achieving today so I really would want::you guys to consider putting investing so much more money into the education for minority students so that we can::together grow as a community and grow in equal education because it's a human::right um is that pension choose between food on their table and educating their::children thank you yep::okay next speaker uh hi my name's Adam I live in the city::of Santa Cruz uh and I'm calling to ask you to agendize uh reducing the funding::for or even eliminating the Santa Cruz City Police Department::um we can give the important work that the police does to other City departments we can maybe not give anyone::the task of running around the city hassling the homeless we could maybe spend the extra money we saved not doing::that on housing homeless uh and I just don't feel comfortable::having the city employing people who are authorized to kill in my name thank you::all right next speaker::not sure if they just dropped off the line::I was in person McKenna Manas::sorry I also called in my phone and then you I got to talk there so thank you okay thanks::all right next speaker::yeah you're on the line oh hello my name is Keith I'm a long time resident here in Santa Cruz um I::would like to call a meeting about uh the red distribution of the uh of the::budget in Santa Cruz um I feel that uh having the police::department taking up as much of the budget as libraries Public Works and economic development::um combined I think that that needs to be uh looked closer at um there's a::there's a memory that a lot of the students here Santa Cruz have um during the cola::demonstrations with police showing up um and breaking a young man's hand and::smacking a young woman on the skull with a baton so viral photos of police kneeling with::us feels more like a stunt and we want to be involved in um their process thank::you thank you::okay next caller you're on the line hello can you hear me yeah hi I just wanted to call to say::absolutely ridiculous that the Santa Cruz Police Department is receiving  million dollars per year::um which is  of the total budget I really think that we should be investing::in issues such as homelessness housing and for sure climate change um and I know that the budget for::climate change projects which would be investing in our future which is super important to me as a young person to::protect our future generations and the City of Santa Cruz um they get like thirty thousand dollars::a year from the general fund and I think that is an insane contrast compared to  million dollars for the police::department so please please please defund them or at least bring it down a substantial amount thank you thank you::hey next speaker thank you::please turn down your device sorry about that um I just want to say my name is Devin rainwater I'm a resident and::student in Santa Cruz and I want to say to be a police officer is a personal and willful choice and it is a job that can::be easily left um officer safety is not discussing the black lives matter movement because it::is not at risk people who are at risk are by puck folks targeted by years of::systemic racism officers are trained for a very small amount of time to be violent and all cops participate in a::fundamentally racist system we must defund the scpd and instead fund public education housing support and mental::health services that will reduce crime in the city::I hope to see my community safe and this means I want to see an abolition of the police::thank you::Annex speaker hello my name is Anna adanski::Georgetown County Mental Health for the last few years mostly the homeless population and substance abusers so::being inside of that system I think that something that's been happening with the police recently::I think that it makes a lot of sense for Santa Cruz County to funnel some of their funds instead to::preventative care and mental health care::uh housing and food Justice I think that we could take away some of the funding::that's going towards tasers batons and outdated things that are police probably don't::need um I'd like to see strangleholds not be used by famous police and overall I'd::just like to see the finances be funded and reinvested into the care of our communities rather than the policing of::our communities oh yeah Mental Health Training for our::police my brother's a police officer so I know these you know hardcore anti-police but I think I::the escalation anti-racial anti-racist training for mental health training::thank you::hey I'm the one hi my name is Remy and I'm here to::discuss a majority of the calls that the police receive are::um about the homeless population which they are not trained to properly deal with funds need to be reallocated to::mental health and Addiction Services education and housing the funding needs::to be reallocated to support our most vulnerable communities thank you::thank you::all right I would like to bring to the campus::attention the urgency of proposal to create a mural on Front Street to show where we stand on black lives::matter and I would also like to support everyone else in defunding the Santa Cruz Police Department and relocating::funds to education climate change and housing::thank you::hi can you hear me yes good evening hi I'm Lane Edwards I'm a resident of::Santa Cruz County I actually moved here a couple years ago from New Orleans and one thing that I was extremely struck by::similarly to many of my fellow community members is that our police are extremely overfunded from New Orleans a city that::has a much more violent crime they actually have a lower percentage of their cities General funds that go to::the police  of crime in Santa Cruz according to the city website is::non-violent property crime I think we all know why this crime has to happen people are not given the housing they::are not giving the resources and the care they need to live I believe that our City's funds would be much better::and much more humanely used to house the homeless and to provide Youth Care over funding the police I strongly suggest::like my community members that we hold a specific budget meaning about defunding::the police and call that we do progressively slash um beginning with ::defund the police and with the goal of understanding the police thank you so much [Music]::again if you wanted to speak during oral Communications you must press on your phone in order to raise your::hand and I think the next person should be on one::hi is that mean yep hi so I have a few concerns first off last month's a  year old black man::named tamario Smith was found alone dead in his jail cell and the cause of death has still not been released::when someone dies in The care of a public safety department the cause of death needs to be public information to hold those departments accountable::um second my friend's  year old son was recently riding his bike home from Pleasure Point in his wetsuit with a::boogie board when he was pulled over by Santa Cruz sheriff's officer who tried to get him in trouble for being at the::beach during the closure as I hope you know the water has remained open for surfing and Boogie boarding during this::closure and my friend's son was not breaking any rules in the middle of the stop the scso officer had to actually::Google the law that he was trying to enforce and as you know scso is enforcing the beach closures in South::County beaches and this racial profiling is an embarrassing reflection of the carelessness that police in Santa Cruz::exhibit on way too many of their law enforcement contacts so please define consider defunding scpd thank you::all right next speaker::hello this is Ryan MSC oh that was just me I::just spoke apparently thank you yeah::okay next speaker I think this is Melanie Jones::okay I'm gonna move on to the next speaker I think::hi um I'm a resident and homeowner here um and I wanted to address the request::by the scpd for an additional  thousand dollars for the next fiscal year I think that we can all agree that::over the course of the past few weeks the world has really woken up to this issue of over policing on how so many of::society's most pressing problems which have the potential to be addressed and rectified are instead being policed::Crews already account for the Lion's Share of our budget so rather than just approve another request for more funding::why not use this particular moment in time this active Global wake-up moment to stop and reflect on how that ::Grand might be better spent other communities that have taken the approach of investing more heavily in Social Services and scaling back on police have::ultimately decreased crime saved taxpayer dollars and elevated human potential given the police have already::received more than two and a half million dollars in additional budget since  right now just seems like the::ideal moment to pause on approving yet another increase and instead step back and address how we can better invest in::our community making Santa Cruz an even better place to live for all thank you [Music]::here [Music]::looks like we got:: people who have their hands that want to speak and sell we'll just give people a minute each for these last  and then::we're going to move on to our evening item::okay next week you're online hello this is Elizabeth Clifton Doolin::I'm a Santa Cruz City resident a long time Community member of  years I support::the Santa Cruz City Police Department under the direction of Andy Mills I::think it is that they need to continue funding and they've done a beautiful job in::de-escalating their staff and keeping us all protected thank you Santa::Cruz Police Department yes::all right next speaker hi my name is Jennifer teschler and I've lived in the west side of Phoenix for::seven years I also want a special Santa Cruz and like many people I was upset to learn that  of the operating::budget goes to the police in our city and that they're asking for even more money especially given them pending::deficit brought by covid I'd like to urge the council to vote against the proposed budget increases the center of office and sepd::instead we allocate current funding towards services that support our community such as housing education and Parks and Rec other cities are adopting::this model as they are confronted with this disproportionate violence inflicted by the police on blast indigenous people::of color and we should not be the last to follow I am a white woman who's allowed to feel safe in Santa Cruz but many of my bike peers do not to the::point that several have fled the cities I will be tracking how the council members vote on this issue and from how::I spend my votes in the next election I'd also like to add perhaps council person schoolers refrain to making::cosmographic remarks like I don't know how to talk about this I'm not a stoner and it's sitting here educate themselves or not speak about things they don't::know how to talk about thank you for your time::all right next speaker hi can you hear me yep good evening::good evening um my name is Cassandra Powell um and I just wanted to address the::Santa Cruz Police Department's social media as a social media manager by trade::five days ago there was a post called A Tale of Two protests in which::the Santa Cruz Police Department on their Facebook Twitter Instagram and on::the city website said that the violent protest::um was led by UCSC grad students but that is not at all true::um and is a blatant Act of defamation and um really trying to divide uh our::community and is a clearly unfounded and blatant attack on our own citizens::um so I'm just calling for the police to do better and to like find their sources and uh really::use their power on social media for the good of the community especially um because that Viral photo of the chief::officer and you may are coming um has increased their follower count by a lot::thank you very much yeah::okay next speaker can you hear me::good evening good evening my name Linda I'm your resident of Santa Cruz County and I just::wanted to say that I support creating a special session to discuss the police::department funding and reallocation of funds to more Community supportive associations and taking some of the::responsibilities that are placed on police and creating alternative departments to address the issues that::could be raised without um forced and I also would like to say that::I support the initiatives to do a mural or the black lives matter movement on::Front Street thank you::all right next speaker hello my name is Elizabeth I'm a::resident of Santa Cruz I want to first take a moment for all the lives that have been lost recently::um from police brutality from the protest or from covid um and then I just want to::support all the calls that have been made to refund and reallocate the::resources that are going towards the police um I think that Santa Cruz deserves to::be a safe and fair place for everybody not just those white wealthy residents::and in making the meeting to make these::budgetary changes that is concretely showing the residents of color that the::Santa Cruz City Council carers and is committed to eradicating the racism that does exist::here and that affects the lives of everybody especially those residents of::color thank you::hello hello I'm on hi thanks for taking my call my name is::Mel I'm a Santa Cruz resident and I want to address the proposed increase to the police budget it doesn't make any sense::to me as well as many other community community members who have stated in this meeting why we would increase the::police department budget to a proposed  of our budget which would be more than multiple sectors combined the::police which historically started as slave Patrol in the south is entrenched in systematic racism I know you all know::what that means I know you know what that means black and brown people are racially profiled in Santa Cruz all the::time we also demand that you immediately stop sending the Santa Cruz Police Department to participate in egregious::violence against against protesters in Oakland this is this is just wrong and I know y'all know that and you have the power::to do something the answer is to defund the police and work towards abolishing the police so that we can truly invest::in community-based Solutions we demand that you call a meeting to address reducing funding for the police::be on the side of Justice on the police do not doubt that we are all watching to see how you show up or fail to show up::for justice thank you::all right next speaker on the line Santa Cruz is a Paradise Beach City::kissed by the Pacific Ocean Breeze and hugged by the Redwood Forest::the city also has a long history of racism that spawns from the oppression of the native peoples to the Daily::harassment or worse of its current non-whites listen to the voices of your people::they have overwhelmingly spoken you fill the city with more police action you fill the city with the image of a town::out of control and who wants to vacation or go to college or buy their house in a heavily policed municipality people::like Justin Bieber vacation in the area because of the giant Dipper not the giant Police Department you have artists::Educators innovators and passionate population to whom you can direct funding to come up with the solutions::needed to make Santa Cruz the amazing place it's always meant to be::the choice is yours you may not have long to make it because the people will speak out and act out against you::this is black [Music]::speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening::hello my name is Nicholas church I was born and raised in Santa Cruz County I'm calling for a defunding and of the::police department taking up  of budget more than Library Public Works and::economic development and ludicrous I'm truly appalled that we would Center Police Department to Oakland to enforce::systemic racism we claim to be one of the most liberal places in California let alone the country we need to act::like it become a Cornerstone for redefining how a community could be protected::the if you do not act if you do not work::towards the allocating resources we will see it you are under a microscope now::act on it I yield my time::foreign hi my name is Avatar Joshi and I'd like::to thank the council members for taking my call I've lived in Santa Cruz for the past five years and I've been a::homeowner for the past two years and I'm calling about the use of excessive force by the police department Across the::Nation and I know that in city of Santa Cruz that a significant portion of the city's operating budget goes to the::police department the sepd uses more Force for arrest than  percent of other police departments in California::and the excessive use of force has even been used against peaceful protesters peaceful student protesters on the::campus of UC Santa Cruz during the cola movement and this is absolutely unacceptable I would like to urge the::council to vote against the proposed budget increases to the Sheriff's Office and the svpd and instead reallocates::their current funding towards services that support our community such as housing and Health Department education::Parks and Rec and Public Works other cities are adopting this model as they're confronting the disproportion of::violence reflected by the police on black indigenous and people of color and::we should not be the last to follow I'll be following how the council members vote and I intend to use this issue to::inform how I vote in the next elections thank you very much for taking my call::yep all right next speaker::hello I am also calling to encourage you to put defunding the police on your next::agenda or to call a special meeting um I agree with everyone that the way we're treating homeless people in this::county is atrocious and we really should be using money that's currently going to::mostly harass homeless people it feels like to support them and to address the::housing affordability crisis thanks y'all::Phoenix speaker hi my name is Ashley I've lived in Santa Cruz for  years as the world grapples::with tough and necessary decisions about systemic racism policing::and funding communities I believe it's far past time Santa Cruz does something in all part of this stop sending our::police to terrorize other communities why is Santa Cruz allowing their cops to go and trample other communities::right to the free of speech we must end these Mutual Aid agreements sccd's::budget budgets going to be more than the economic development Community Development and Public Works combined::with housing crisis climate change at our front door and a pandemic in our hands we must think progressively and::spending money money for forward change I hope that the council takes us to heart and will push for official time::for a community to express in depth their concerns and their hopes for a future of this city and take a closer::look at the proposed increase sbcd's budget and see that if the money would be spent better elsewhere thank you::give::all right next speaker hi my name is Veronica Varner::I'm frankly appalled by the proposal to a lot . percent of the budget towards policing these budget increases are::clearly not investing back into our community the one million dollar budget to alleviate homelessness one of the most pressing issues in Santa Cruz::especially during the time of covid- pales in comparison as was only eight an::eight hundred thousand dollar budget for project room key in Santa Cruz there are   individuals experiencing::homelessness with a whopping  unsheltered in Santa Cruz with only  grams allotted by project green case::with the city spending  million of City resources towards quote reacting to the impact of homelessness it is clear::that more policing is not going to fix the issue we must reallocate funds towards affordable housing shelters::Rehabilitation programs related to drugs or mental illness the city is currently burning through money an abusive cycle::of arrest and release with its population experiencing homelessness and the criminalization of this population::break the chain reallocate this money and invest in bettering our community defend the police::all right next speaker hi my name is Emory wedel I live in Santa Cruz California and I'm also::calling to defund the

right next speaker uh yes Charles Lee wood I'm a resident of Santa Cruz I think uh the what the::police department is doing is absolutely wonderful I think it should be fully funded I I see::from what

thank you::all right next speaker hi can you hear me yes good evening::um hi this is paper developer and I basically just wanted to Echo what so many others have said and really urge::you guys to

would like to Echo the calls to uh::he fund the police and invest in uh Community programs I would also like::to add that a variety of sociological and criminal criminal logical::research on the causes of crime has shown that at least in part crime::occurs in um because pockets of::concentrated disadvantage deny people opportunities to participate::in community in their Greater Community and uh::invest there for investing in community works and programs that::center community Advocates from within these neighborhoods is a way to::lower crime rates therefore::the need for highly militarized police forces which in fact incite violence as::we have seen across the country this week thank you for taking my call::evening can you hear me yes my name is Santiago as a longtime resident of Santa Cruz I'm calling for::an immediate community meeting or at least for you to add to your agenda the discussion of our current and projected::budgets with the intention specifically of

the defending on the Santa Cruz Police Department and::the reallocation of those funds to community-based programs that are in high demand such as housing mental health education harm reduction::Addiction Services and many more policing these issues has been proven to be ineffective and only hurts our::community further I would also ask that we step away from the practice of mutual Aid which uses taxpayer dollars to enact::violence in cities like Oakland against citizens who are using their right to peacefully protest I would like to also::remind each of you that the members of this community will be watching and will hold each of you accountable for the actions you take in the coming weeks and::months thank you yeah okay we have a few speakers what::um then we'll likely
