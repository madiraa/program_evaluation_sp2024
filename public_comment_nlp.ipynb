We will not be taking dialogue.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:55:47\\nYeah. Okay. Yeah. Hello.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:55:53\\nAt table we will address the questions raised at the end of oral communications. I'd like to ask.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:55:59\\nRobert North from Huff has reached out to us early to request 4\\xa0min. So Robert North, if you're listening, when it's your time to speak, please make yourself known so that we can give you the appropriate amount of time.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:01\\nYes.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:06\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:09\\nYeah. Yeah. Okay. The little buddy.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:15\\nWith that, I will start while communications.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:21\\nOkay, you're on the line. Hi, this is Robert North, yes. So Homeless United again.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:22\\nOkay. Can you.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:27\\nMaintenance was declared police appreciation weak and indeed I heard they were giving out several dozen sandwiches a week at some point and I'm glad to hear that.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:34\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:37\\nHowever, food not bombs recently celebrated its fortieth anniversary and hundreds of people. Many hours a day.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:39\\nYeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:47\\nAnd it's time, it's time the mayor acknowledged this and declared next week food not bombs appreciation week.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:56\\nOkay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:56:56\\nThey've taken action, they provided food. Hotel vouchers, survival services. When the police contributions were forced illegal relocations and fences.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:07\\nThank you.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:08\\nCity Council as well as predecessors says a regular habit of rubber stamping with staffs presentations. This is another concern I have.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:17\\nYeah Hey.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:17\\nAnd the current COVID crisis, city managers, seriously threatening the health and welfare of those outside. And without exception or debate received the thumbs up from a complacent Compleasant and Compliant City Council.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:26\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:30\\nThis is a dangerous situation in the community that wants real democratic process, public input and a significant discussion of important issues.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:33\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:38\\nDo your jobs. We heard the mayor's regular announcement gagging any public input, comment, or questions.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:39\\nGood.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:45\\nOh.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:45\\nOn what is probably the most important section of the public meeting reports by the city manager and the city attorney who heard it again today if we were listening.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:52\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:53\\nThere is no public questioning of these powerful people and the staff they work with whose frequently reactionary agenda reflects the interests of its own bureaucracy, private developers, select and favored nonprofits, and its own powerful department heads.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:57:54\\nOkay. Thank you. Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:04\\nYeah. Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:10\\nNow last year several council members tried to let some air and light into this process. They tried to take the agenda making process out of the back room.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:13\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:17\\nOkay. Good.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:17\\nThere was even rumors of a progressive majority on the city council at that time. But apparently one person, Mayor Cummings, turned the other way.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:22\\nThank you.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:26\\nAnd now, of course, he's even lost that powerful, pivotal position as we see by his failure to be able to get votes today.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:28\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:32\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:33\\nAlthough I'm glad to see he's trying.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:36\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:39\\nThe reverse the gentrification agenda driving long time Santa Cruz renters out of town.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:40\\nYeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:44\\nIt's still a big priority. It's taken a global pandemic to get officials to begin. Even limited gestures toward the basic sanitary and life necessities for those without shelter outside.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:50\\nThank you. Okay. Yeah. Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:58:56\\nGestures that are likely to disappear once business as usual is reinstituted. Council members Glover and Crown were punished, silenced and evicted by the powerful interests whose narratives they challenged.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:01\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:06\\nHello. And.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:07\\nLong presentations by staff members with no possibility of questions to be asked. An answer from the public does us and the council no favors.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:14\\nThank you. Bye.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:16\\nAll in its way, survival encampments, particularly autonomous resident run encampments, have been a long time need in demand of activist progressive social service providers.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:25\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:25\\nFrom their damn few in Santa Cruz. And of course folks outside themselves. The benchland encampment initiated as Freud's encampments have been by homeless people themselves.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:31\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:36\\nAlso, the weather we got that we need now, and that's what I'm bringing to your attention, or what they need.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:37\\nWell, Okay. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:42\\nI'm indoors myself. Also lack, we have a lack of accessible potable water as of a few days ago.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:50\\nYeah. Oh. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 14:59:50\\nLack of electrical access so homeless people can charge their phones, have access to services into the latest. Kovat 19 updates these are unnet needs ignored by the city manager as well as the obvious flooding problem in the bench lands which may be coming up soon, which seriously impacts them.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:04\\nSo.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:07\\nCity Council needs to jump ahead and direct the city manager to provide the motel rooms. For all who need them during the crisis and he needs to be directed to address the needs of the number of those turnally outside providing the recharging, sanitary and water needs that obviously impact their health and the health of the entire community.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:10\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:19\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:23\\nYeah. Good morning!\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:24\\nWe're being told this is all an emergency. Well, as any council member do have the ovaries or the balls to stand up and make an emergency resolution given the fact that none of these facts were presented by the manager earlier.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:41\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:41\\nThank you. Thank you. Again, for members of public who are listening, this is oral communications portion of the city council meeting.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:44\\nOkay. Okay, Here. Hello.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:49\\nIf you've called in and you'd like to speak to us on oral communications or on items that are not on our agenda.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:54\\nWe press star not on your phone to raise your hand. And you will be unmuted when 2 times speak.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:00:59\\nYes.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:02\\nIt's next up. Okay, this is Garrett Philip. When Marx ruled the self annoyed authority coming straight from God or the Roman Emperor Maximus declared, all I survey is mine.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:08\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:15\\nThat was one way to run an empire. Today we will just have to be satisfied with people being told they need security.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:22\\nThe government provides the chains and then they are secure in them. Besides, the continuing Kovat kill switch lockdown response is very helpful to the totalitarian collectivist socialists, communist when leftists because if it doesn't work they can argue for an even bigger government footprint, savaging self-responsibility, liberty, and demand even more subservience to the all-wise, even bigger beneficent central\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:23\\nOh\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:33\\nYeah. Yeah. Hello.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:43\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:45\\nauthority. It's also quite helpful backdrop to generating big pharma riches. I can't do it for the congressional pork stuffers to distribute fortunes and ruinous debt, a chance to blame, economic doom on the other political party for political gain to attack freedom, promote debt slavery, blame capitalism and bailout the bad actor corporations.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:50\\nHello.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:01:53\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:02:05\\nLiberty, your job, and a lot of us are now deemed personally non-essential and everyone else that is subjugating gets a hero's check.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:02:14\\nNevermind this, until we're safe, I mean, actually means never because we are never safe.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:02:14\\nOkay. Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:02:17\\nYour light is not about being safe. Never mind control is but an illusion and life is but a journey and don't get caught saying that any more than taking a prohibited walk on the beach between 11 and 5 p.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:02:29\\nM. Never mind, children have few symptoms that really very few die of kovat. Their personal growth is now permanently altered and they'll be the ones involuntarily inheriting the unimaginable debt dollars we burn like trash now and suffer from inflation produce wants and suffer the ever-increasing wealth and equality jet fuel of inflation.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:02:48\\nKeep saying this is the new normal, even if nothing about this is normal. I'd like to be a member of an institutionally sociopathic ruling elite cast also, but it looks like one needs to be Pelosi's nephew to be in that club or amygdala maniac monopolist with the health care dominance ambition.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:02:56\\nHmm.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:06\\nThe hospitals are now empty because people are afraid to go skipping needed health care and apparently Brainiacs aren't available to figure out how to safely get a haircut.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:14\\nThanks.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:16\\nI see my time is up. Bye. Right.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:19\\nYeah. Okay. How do you know? Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:22\\nIf there's any member of the public who would like to address us some items that are not on our agenda.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:28\\nNow is the time to call in and start 9 on your phone to raise your hand.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:41\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:44\\nYou have 2\\xa0min. Thank you. Hello, my name is Karen Behrer and I am a resident and employee of the city of Santa Cruz.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:46\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:50\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:03:50\\nI'm proud to be part of the SEIU, 5, point, one.

We need to raise funds to invest in a healthy future for Santa Cruz.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:03\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:09\\nWe in at CIU, 500, and, 21, are advocating with or contain invest in a healthy future now.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:10\\nYes.

Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:33\\nAnd advocate for the, here was that.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:34\\n1 million dollars in federal stimulus for state and local governments. As well as hazard pay for essential workers.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:36\\nHmm.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:42\\nThis bill has already passed the US House of Representatives now in the state. Senate, excuse me, US Senate, needs to vote on this.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:43\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:48\\nYeah. Right. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:51\\nBill and we are doing everything we can to support it even contact with voters in Arizona to tell their senator to vote yes we want to partner with the city to advocate and lobby for the heroes act so we can invest in our city's economy and keep people working.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:04:56\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:06\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:10\\nAs city workers, we have done our part when the last recession hit. This coming recession may be avoided altogether if partnered together to advocate for funding and we make decisions based on the facts when it is time.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:12\\nOkay. Yeah. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:22\\nThe time to implement furlough is not now. They must evaluate the actual impact of COVID-19 on our city and look for options before we decide to cut.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:29\\nThank you.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:33\\nSome actions may include ensuring all departments are tracking expenditures for the purpose of drawing down federal funds. And conducting odds of all departments reevaluating the need for existing consulting contracts, reevaluating management structure to give given the increase in telework.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:43\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:48\\nHello\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:52\\nIncludes. Thank you very much for your time today. Yes.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:54\\nThank you. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:05:59\\nAlright, next caller. Hello, my name is James, you're in women. I'm just going to read something I wrote a couple days ago.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:03\\nNo check, don't go too far, Good.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:08\\nBy Dane Whittington, November sixteenth, 2,019, presentation number 223.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:10\\nYeah. Yeah, I think that too. I know it's still out for deliberation. I haven't gotten.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:16\\n10 wars are upon Earth's biosphere. This pandemic has produced at least these 2 results. One, established what seems like an almost trillion dollar funding for even more surveillance capitalism and make no error and either do your own research or inquire for me hundreds of links to the nefarious goals of the already patented vaccine.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:25\\nI know it's still out for deliberation. I haven't gotten infested yet. He's, he's some kind of mutt.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:28\\nHe's, I, when I adopted him, his vet record said either Terry or Mix or Tiwala Mix? Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:38\\nYeah, I see like yellow lab and pickle. Okay. Maybe some Chihuahua because his legs are so short.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:40\\nThe propaganda machines have placed fear and blind fiduciary trust in most citizens. Further, our children will be affected the most.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:43\\nThen teachers and law enforcement and emergency responders along with those who work in hospitals. As World War 2 never ended the ABCs at war, Secret High, now have wireless weapons installed in all the above street rights and home technologies.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:46\\nI don't know. Yeah, I plan to do that eventually. I just haven't gotten around to.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:06:56\\nI kinda like the mystery. His name is Milkshake. Yeah. Hello.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:00\\nAs such the Nets Biological Warfare, 36 month cycle wave will magnify cubed with the actual weapons to put in my glasses.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:12\\nVery few deaths from this bio weapon. Anyone can find my post and listen to my statements in Santa Cruz City Council about wires, weapons, weapons, technologies released.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:16\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:21\\nRight.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:22\\nIn 1976, 8,500 declassified documents from the US military department, the US Military Department of Defence, Department of Energy and the Surgeon General.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:25\\nYeah,\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:33\\nI will include this information about other various issues going on with life on Earth. April 20 fifth, 2,020.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:43\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:44\\nI will say this again about the sham, the shutdown has already greatly affected the global the global food supply change.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:07:51\\nIf that is not remedy very soon, agenda 21, 2,030. Clearly established in Santa Cruz County in 1,993 will retrieve most of its goals at least 6 years early.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:01\\nAnd yes, I welcome questions and remarks from those too fearful to start thinking. For their grandchildren's grandchildren.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:01\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:07\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:09\\nThank you.

Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:38\\nOkay, it seems no new members of the public interested in speaking to some old communications. I'll conclude oral communications at this time.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:46\\nHowever, before we move on, I just wanted to point out that after we had voted on item number 15.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:46\\nOkay. Okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:56\\nOkay. Good.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:08:57\\nI received an email from. Public works director, one of the point the concerns I had was having this the item go to the Transportation Public Works Commission and it turns out that at the request of the commission, they held a meeting.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:04\\nThank you.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:09\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:16\\nOn October eighteenth or October 20 first. 2,019 adult elementary school. Where This project along with a number of other projects were on display for community to weigh in on.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:26\\nAlright.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:30\\nOkay. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:34\\nAnd so given that. We were able to understand that this did go back to the commission and there was further public engagement.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:36\\nOkay. Yeah. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:44\\nI'd be willing to reconsider my vote on. That I am.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:47\\nHello. Yeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:53\\nCouple of miles.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:55\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:09:57\\nI would make a motion to reconsider item number 15. Based on the information that you just provided and I also was able to read the email that was provided as well.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:09\\nOkay, I'll second that motion. no, nothing. Thank you.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:15\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:19\\nOkay, so, I do have a question. Sorry. I do have a question. I mean, that's exactly what Chris told us.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:30\\nEarlier. My understanding from earlier was that he wasn't sure what date it was. But it is true the commission never sat down as 7 commissioners.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:31\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:43\\nAnd heard the project and took a vote.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:46\\nYes. Good.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:47\\nAnd look, my understanding from the email that we received is the request of the transportation public works commission. Was that they hold this meeting and this.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:54\\nYeah.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:10:57\\nProject being part of that. So I understand that, but instead, okay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:11:02\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:11:04\\nYeah, that's my understanding from the email. And I understand that too. That's what he said all along.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:11:11\\nOkay. So I guess we'll call, have a roll call to reconsider.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:11:17\\nOkay.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:11:19\\nBut are we reconsidering? Oh, just to confirm, this is a, this is a vote to reconsider the item.\\n\\n[Madison Raasch] 15:11:26\\nAnd then you'll take a revote. Oh, okay. Thank you.

They tried to take the agenda making process out of the back room.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay.

And.[Madison Raasch] ::Long presentations by staff members with no possibility of questions to be asked. An answer from the public does us and the council no favors.[Madison Raasch] ::Thank you. Bye.[Madison Raasch] ::All in its way, survival encampments, particularly autonomous resident run encampments, have been a long time need in demand of activist progressive social service providers.[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah.[Madison Raasch] ::From their damn few in Santa Cruz. And of course folks outside themselves. The benchland encampment initiated as Freud's encampments have been by homeless people themselves.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay.[Madison Raasch] ::Also, the weather we got that we need now, and that's what I'm bringing to your attention, or what they need.[Madison Raasch] ::Well, Okay. Yeah.[Madison Raasch] ::I'm indoors myself. Also lack, we have a lack of accessible potable water as of a few days ago.[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah. Oh. Yeah.[Madison Raasch] ::Lack of electrical access so homeless people can charge their phones, have access to services into the latest. Kovat  updates these are unnet needs ignored by the city manager as well as the obvious flooding problem in the bench lands which may be coming up soon, which seriously impacts them.[Madison Raasch] ::So.[Madison Raasch] ::City Council needs to jump ahead and direct the city manager to provide the motel rooms. For all who need them during the crisis and he needs to be directed to address the needs of the number of those turnally outside providing the recharging, sanitary and water needs that obviously impact their health and the health of the entire community.[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay.[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah. Good morning![Madison Raasch] ::We're being told this is all an emergency. Well, as any council member do have the ovaries or the balls to stand up and make an emergency resolution given the fact that none of these facts were presented by the manager earlier.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay.[Madison Raasch] ::Thank you. Thank you. Again, for members of public who are listening, this is oral communications portion of the city council meeting.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay. Okay, Here.

When Marx ruled the self annoyed authority coming straight from God or the Roman Emperor Maximus declared, all I survey is mine.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay.[Madison Raasch] ::That was one way to run an empire. Today we will just have to be satisfied with people being told they need security.[Madison Raasch] ::The government provides the chains and then they are secure in them. Besides, the continuing Kovat kill switch lockdown response is very helpful to the totalitarian collectivist socialists, communist when leftists because if it doesn't work they can argue for an even bigger government footprint, savaging self-responsibility, liberty, and demand even more subservience to the all-wise, even bigger beneficent central[Madison Raasch] ::Oh[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah. Yeah. Hello.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay.[Madison Raasch] ::authority. It's also quite helpful backdrop to generating big pharma riches. I can't do it for the congressional pork stuffers to distribute fortunes and ruinous debt, a chance to blame, economic doom on the other political party for political gain to attack freedom, promote debt slavery, blame capitalism and bailout the bad actor corporations.[Madison Raasch] ::Hello.[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah.[Madison Raasch] ::Liberty, your job, and a lot of us are now deemed personally non-essential and everyone else that is subjugating gets a hero's check.[Madison Raasch] ::Nevermind this, until we're safe, I mean, actually means never because we are never safe.[Madison Raasch] ::Okay. Okay.[Madison Raasch] ::Your light is not about being safe. Never mind control is but an illusion and life is but a journey and don't get caught saying that any more than taking a prohibited walk on the beach between  and  p.[Madison Raasch] ::M. Never mind, children have few symptoms that really very few die of kovat. Their personal growth is now permanently altered and they'll be the ones involuntarily inheriting the unimaginable debt dollars we burn like trash now and suffer from inflation produce wants and suffer the ever-increasing wealth and equality jet fuel of inflation.[Madison Raasch] ::Keep saying this is the new normal, even if nothing about this is normal. I'd like to be a member of an institutionally sociopathic ruling elite cast also, but it looks like one needs to be Pelosi's nephew to be in that club or amygdala maniac monopolist with the health care dominance ambition.[Madison Raasch] ::Hmm.[Madison Raasch] ::The hospitals are now empty because people are afraid to go skipping needed health care and apparently Brainiacs aren't available to figure out how to safely get a haircut.[Madison Raasch] ::Thanks.[Madison Raasch] ::I see my time is up. Bye. Right.[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah. Okay. How do you know? Yeah.[Madison Raasch] ::If there's any member of the public who would like to address us some items that are not on our agenda.[Madison Raasch] ::Now is the time to call in and start  on your phone to raise your hand.[Madison Raasch] ::Yeah.[Madison Raasch] ::You have  min.

gagging any public input, comment, or questions.[] ::good.[] ::oh.[] ::on what is probably the most important section of the public meeting reports by the city manager and the city attorney who heard it again today if we were listening.[] ::okay.[] ::there is no public questioning of these powerful people and the staff they work with whose frequently reactionary agenda reflects the interests of its own bureaucracy, private developers, select and favored nonprofits, and its own powerful department heads.[] ::okay. thank you. okay.[] ::yeah. okay.[] ::now last year several council members tried to let some air and light into this process. they tried to take the agenda making process out of the back room.[] ::okay.[] ::okay. good.[] ::there was even rumors of a progressive majority on the city council at that time. but apparently one person, mayor cummings, turned the other way.[] ::thank you.[] ::and now, of course, he's even lost that powerful, pivotal position as we see by his

public does us and the council no favors.[] ::thank you. bye.[] ::all in its way, survival encampments, particularly autonomous resident run encampments, have been a long time need in demand of activist progressive social service providers.[] ::yeah.[] ::from their damn few in santa cruz. and of course folks outside themselves. the benchland encampment initiated as freud's encampments have been by homeless people themselves.[] ::okay.[] ::also, the weather we got that we need now, and that's what i'm bringing to your attention, or what they need.[] ::well, okay. yeah.[] ::i'm indoors myself. also lack, we have a lack of accessible potable water as of a few days ago.[] ::yeah. oh. yeah.[] ::lack of electrical access so homeless people can charge their phones, have access to services into the latest. kovat  updates these are unnet needs ignored by the city manager as well as the obvious flooding problem in the bench lands which may be coming up soon, which seriously impacts them.[] ::so.[] ::city council needs to jump ahead and direct the city manager to provide the motel rooms. for all who need them during the crisis and he needs to be directed to address the needs of the number of those turnally outside providing the recharging, sanitary and water needs that obviously impact their health and the health of the entire community.[] ::yeah.[] ::okay.[] ::yeah. good morning![] ::we're being told this is all an emergency. well, as any council member do have the ovaries or the balls to stand up and make an emergency resolution given the fact that none of these facts were presented by the manager earlier.[] ::okay.[] ::thank you. thank you. again, for members of public who are listening, this is oral communications portion of the city council

your hand. and you will be unmuted when  times speak.[] ::yes.[] ::it's next up. okay, this is garrett philip. when marx ruled the self annoyed authority coming straight from god or the roman emperor maximus declared, all i survey is mine.[] ::okay.[] ::that was one way to run an empire. today we will just have to be satisfied with people being told they need security.[] ::the government provides the chains and then they are secure in them. besides, the continuing kovat kill switch lockdown response is very helpful to the totalitarian collectivist socialists, communist when leftists because if it doesn't work they can argue for an even bigger government footprint, savaging self-responsibility, liberty, and demand even more subservience to the all-wise, even bigger beneficent central[] ::oh[] ::yeah. yeah. hello.[] ::okay.[] ::authority. it's also quite helpful backdrop to generating big pharma riches. i can't do it for the congressional pork stuffers to distribute fortunes and ruinous debt, a chance to blame, economic doom on the other political party for political gain to attack freedom, promote debt slavery, blame capitalism and bailout the bad actor corporations.[] ::hello.[] ::yeah.[] ::liberty, your job, and a lot of us are now deemed personally non-essential and everyone else that is subjugating gets a hero's check.[] ::nevermind this, until we're safe, i mean, actually means never because we are never safe.[] ::okay. okay.[] ::your light is not about being safe. never mind control is but an illusion and life is but a journey and don't get caught saying that any more than taking a prohibited walk on the beach between  and  p.[] ::m. never mind, children have few symptoms that really very few die of kovat. their personal growth is now permanently altered and they'll be the ones involuntarily inheriting the unimaginable debt dollars we burn like trash now and suffer from inflation produce wants and suffer the ever-increasing wealth and equality jet fuel of inflation.[] ::keep saying this is the new normal, even if nothing about this is normal. i'd like to be a member of an institutionally sociopathic ruling elite cast also, but
